<span style="font-size: 11.0pt">In May 2015, the well-known human rights 
	lawyer Pu Zhiqiang was arrested after he participated in a seminar on the 25<sup>th</sup> 
	anniversary of June-Fourth Movement at his friend’s home. He spent 19 months 
	in prison. Later, he was charged of “inflicting racial hatred and causing 
	social disturbance”, due to his postings of criticisms on Chinese officials 
	and policies on Weibo. The court stated that the verdict would be 
	accordingly released after 3 hours of hearing. Pu did not plead guilty. This 
	shows that the authorities deprive people’s rights of freedom of speech.</span></p>

<span style="font-size: 11.0pt">Pu Zhiqiang should be released 
	unconditionally and immediately. It has been too long to get him imprisoned 
	for 19 months. Under the pressure from international and domestic human 
	rights lawyers, the authorities at last stated that Pu was </span>
<span style="font-size: 11.0pt">given a suspended three-year prison 
	sentence.</span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt"> Pu said he would not 
	appeal. However, he has not been released yet. That means that he may be 
	sentenced to prison due to any accused misbehaviors.</span></p>

<span style="font-size: 11.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another case is the famous 
	journalist, Gao Yu. The court </span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt">convicted 
</span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt">Gao </span>
<span style="font-size: 11.0pt">of leaking state secrets</span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt">, 
	and gave her seven-year prison sentence. She has suffered a lot, as she is 
	70 years old and has serious illness. With the medical document issued by 
	the hospital, she was given a 3 to 5-year suspended prison sentence, which 
	will be conducted outside prison. Nonetheless, she has not yet regained 
	unconditionally her freedom.</span></p>

<span style="font-size: 11.0pt">In the Christmas of 2009, Liu Xiaobo, a 
	human rights defender who drafted “Charter 08” and Nobel Peace Prize 
	Laureate, was charged of “i</span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt">nciting 
	subversion of state power&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt">” and was 
	given 11-year prison sentence. He has suffered for years in prison, and his 
	wife, Liu Xia, is forcibly detained at home, so she has no contact with the 
	outside world. Liu should be released immediately as well. The old cases 
	have not been settled, meanwhile, there are new cases. Guo Feixiong, a human 
	rights defender from Guangdong province, was firstly charged of </span>
<span style="font-size: 11.0pt; background: white">&quot;disturbing order in 
	public space&quot;</span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; background: white">, and 
	then</span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt"> of “causing social disturbance<span style="background: white">”, 
	so he was sentenced to 6 years in prison. He is actually innocent. It only 
	proves that the court is an absolutely obedient servant to the authorities.</span></span></p>

<span style="font-size: 11.0pt">After taking supreme powers of the CPC, 
	government, and military, Xi Jinping immediately restricted democratic 
	rights outside and inside the CPC. Through 14-month revision of “</span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt">The 
	Regulation of the CPC</span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt"> </span>
<span style="font-size: 11.0pt">on Disciplinary Actions</span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt">”, 
	the Central Committee of the CPC announced to ban freedom of speech and 
	press freedom. For example, Zhao Xinwei, the secretary of CPC of <i>Xinjiang 
	Daily</i>, the editor-in-chief, and the deputy director of the press, was 
	not only expelled from the CPC and the press, but also being prosecuted by 
	the court, </span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt">for ‘improperly’ 
	discussing government policy in </span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt">Xinjiang</span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt"> region</span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt">. 
	Similarly, Zhao Guoming, </span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt">head of the 
	region's poverty-relief office, w</span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt">as
	</span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt">also prosecuted for </span>
<span style="font-size: 11.0pt">seriously violating political disciplines (3 
	November, <i>Ming Po</i>).</span></p>

<span style="font-size: 11.0pt">According to another news report of <i>Ming 
	Po</i>, the mouthpiece of </span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt">the 
	Commission for Discipline Inspection of the Central Committee of the CPC</span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt"> 
	disclosed that a deputy director of the public security bureau of a city who 
	commented on the policy of “one country, two systems” among the circles of 
	Weixin, was punished politically due to his violation of the provision of 
	“any </span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; background: white">cadre</span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; background: white"> 
	is </span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; background: white">forbidden to 
	comment freely on the core policies of </span>
<span style="font-size: 11.0pt; background: white">the CPC</span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt">” 
	of the newly revised regulation. There are many examples to prove that the 
	CPC practices centralism but not democracy. It violates the principle of 
	democratic centralism which Lenin upholds.</span></p>

<span style="font-size: 11.0pt">Outside the CPC, freedom of speech is 
	further restricted. If any netizen spreads “false news” among the internet 
	social platforms such as Weixin or Weibo, he will be convicted of criminal 
	law. The longest prison sentence is 7 years. This may lead to wrong cases of 
	“</span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; background: white">literary 
	inquisition</span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt">”, such as Xin Lijian, an 
	out-spoken internet commentator, was interrogated by the police. Hong Kong 
	is also affected. For example, Wang Jianmin, a former senior commentator of 
	Asiaweek, and Guo Zhongjiao, its editor, published political magazines, 
	i.e., <i>Xinweiyuekan</i> and <i>Multiple Face</i> in Hong Kong, and then 
	were arrested due to “illegal operation”. They were prosecuted after one and 
	half year of detention. Wang has two more charges of “bribery” and “cover 
	bidding”. This shows that the authorities are &nbsp;determined to send Wang into 
	prison.</span></p>

<span style="font-size: 11.0pt">Yao Wentian, the owner of Hong Kong Morning 
	Bell Press, published many books about the dark side of the CPC. Last year, 
	in Shenzhen, he was sentenced to prison for 10 years, charged with 
	“smuggling chemical raw materials”. All these show that the CPC suppress 
	press freedom in Hong Kong through </span>
<span style="font-size: 11.0pt; background: white">literary inquisition (5 
	November, <i>Apple Daily</i>). This openly violates the Basic Law which 
	guarantees Hong Kong people to enjoy freedom of speech and press freedom.</span></p>

<span style="font-size: 11.0pt; background: white">Reporters Without 
	Borders, China was the top one country which sent the largest number of 
	reporters and internet media workers into prison. Recently, another
