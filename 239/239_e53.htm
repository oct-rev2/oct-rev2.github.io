<span style="font-size: 11.0pt">summarized its latest 5-year plan </span>
<span style="font-size: 11.0pt">with </span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt">‘Innovation’, ‘Coordination’, ‘Green’, ‘Opening up’, and Benefit-sharing’</span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt">.</span></p>

<span style="font-size: 11.0pt">The most difficult part of building a 
	well-off society lies in rural areas. If China needs a balanced development, 
	it should coordinate well both urban and rural development. Public services 
	can be extended to the countryside in order to enhance its living standard. 
	Unfortunately, the CPC policy always sacrifices rural society and exploits 
	peasants. Now the document vows to make a balance, in that poor rural areas 
	will receive more national public fund, and peasants will share more public 
	resources. It comes true only if the policy can be implemented in reality.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="layout-grid-mode: char; line-height: 150%; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 0">
<span style="font-size: 11.0pt">Shortly afterwards, t</span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt">he 
	CPC Central Committee</span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt"> issued a 
	Communiqu&eacute; which claims to adopt green development policy, to take a path of 
	ecological civilization, and to promote beautiful China. It also suggests to 
	set up main functional regions for the protection of national land 
	development, as well as to install systems of management and supervision in 
	the environmental protection organizations under the provincial level.</span></p>

<span style="font-size: 11.0pt; color: black">Xi Jinping claimed that 
	ecological problems like serious pollutions of air, water, and soil became 
	barriers of building a well-off society. People desperately need to overcome 
	these ecological problems. It is one of the important missions of the 13<sup>th</sup> 
	Five-year Plan. Nevertheless, Xi pointed out four difficulties of tackling 
	environmental problems: first, supervision on local governments and involved 
	sectors; second, interference into law enforcement of environmental 
	organization by local conservatism……</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="layout-grid-mode: char; line-height: 150%; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 0">
<span style="font-size: 11.0pt; color: black">Why is the central government 
	unable to fulfill the responsibility of supervision on local governments? 
	This is because the CPC has long adopted capitalist market economy. Many 
	officials have become privileged, money-minded, and corrupted. So it is 
	difficult for the central government to enforce the law at the ground level. 
	Xi speaks out the inconvenient but widespread truth.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="layout-grid-mode: char; line-height: 150%; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 0">
<span style="font-size: 11.0pt; color: black">Ironically, after the 
	announcement of the </span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt">Communiqu&eacute;<span style="color: black"> 
	which claims to carry out the strictest environmental policy, the residents 
	of Boyang Lake, the largest freshwater lake in Jiangxi Province, China, went 
	to demonstration, against pollutions caused by chemical plants which were 
	supported by local government. There were nearly ten thousand demonstrators 
	on the streets. The police suppressed the demonstration with batons, tear 
	gas, and even shot the masses with riot guns and rubber bullets. Many people 
	were wounded. What Jiangxi provincial government did was smearing the </span>Communiqu&eacute;<span style="color: black"> (5 November, 
<i>Apple Daily</i>).</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="layout-grid-mode: char; line-height: 150%; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 0">
<span style="font-size: 11.0pt; color: black">This again revealed that local 
	officials conspired with chemical plants for profit-making, which led to 
	environmental devastation. The chemical plants caused pollution problems 
	through gas emissions into the air, waste effluents into the river and 
	farmland. All these have endangered people’s livelihood and have caused 
	health problems. However, the local government turned a blind eye to that 
	issue.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="layout-grid-mode: char; line-height: 150%; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 0">
<span style="font-size: 11.0pt; color: black">In addition, it is hardly to
	</span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt">install systems of management and 
	supervision in the environmental protection organizations under the 
	provincial level. According to <i>Wen Wei Po</i>, dated 2 November 2015, the 
	headings were “Smog swallowed Beijing, day was night, people cried out: all 
	eyes, noses, and throats were in pain”. The phenomenon was nearly the same 
	with the fatal smog in London of 1952. Now, Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei 
	Province, among others, are trapped in smog. This proves that PM 2.5 is very 
	serious in those areas.</span></p>

<b><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; color: black">“Benefit-sharing” may be

<span style="font-size: 11.0pt; color: black">In order to fulfill the fifth 
	goal of benefit-sharing, the document determinedly makes concrete 
	instructions and timetables. As Professor Wang Yukai remarks, the 
	fundamental issue is how to make five levels of governments put the ideal 
	policy into practice. In other words, it means it is impossible to carry out 
	the policy one level by one level.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="layout-grid-mode: char; line-height: 150%; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 0">
<span style="font-size: 11.0pt; color: black">Professor Wang argues that 
	China has great achievement of reform and development, but people do not 
	share the fruits. This has led to an enlarging gap between the rich and the 
	poor, income disparity, and regional unbalanced development. Social 
	conflicts and riots were widespread. Put simply, the last several decades of 
	development did not bring social justice to all Chinese people, and wealth 
	is concentrated in a few hands. He analyzes that wealth is concentrated in 
	governments; wealth is concentrated in capitalists; and wealth is 
	concentrated in monopolized enterprises. The three kinds of wealth 
	concentration led to disparity between rich and poor, as well as social 
	confrontations. People cast doubts on government policy which claims to 
	uphold social justice. The key question is: can we let all people enjoy the 
	fruits of reform and development?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="layout-grid-mode: char; line-height: 150%; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 0">
<span style="font-size: 11.0pt; color: black">China has adopted capitalist 
	market economy for more than 30 years. The unjust wealth concentration is 
	the outcome of the logic of capitalist development which cannot be changed 
	by any personal will. It can be corrected only if we build the real 
	socialist and communist systems which guarantee social justice and wealth 
	distribution. Nonetheless, it is impossible for today’s China and its 
	capitalist system to do it. The Communiqu&eacute; proposed some solutions. However, 
	people in charge of wealth distribution may take advantage of this progress.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="layout-grid-mode: char; line-height: 150%; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 0">
<span style="font-size: 11.0pt; color: black">The Communiqu&eacute; also proposes 
	to improve the health care system, to control price of medicine, and to 
	reform insurance policy, in order to build a modern basic health system and 
	hospital management which can cover both urban and rural areas. Although the 
	existing medical system can be guaranteed in the city and the countryside, 
	the standard is low. China is still struggling to construct a medical system 
	with high-level standard.</span></p>

<span style="font-size: 11.0pt; color: black">The Communiqu&eacute; also proposes 
	to implement two-child policy, in order to address the problem of aging 
	society.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="layout-grid-mode: char; line-height: 150%; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 0">
<span style="font-size: 11.0pt; color: black">The CPC carried out the 
	strictest one-child policy during the 1980s. One couple is allowed to have 
	only one child. There were horrible slogans such as “Beat it. Abort it. Kick 
	it. Absolutely not to deliver it”, “We want to have ten graveyards rather 
	than a baby”, “Give you a piece of rope to hang, give you a bottle of poison 
	to drink”. People who violated the policy were seriously punished, so did 
	rural officials who failed to enforce the law.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="layout-grid-mode: char; line-height: 150%; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 0">
<span style="font-size: 11.0pt; color: black">According to <i>China Health 
	Statistics Year Book 2010</i>, since China adopted one-child policy, the 
	number of abortions reached 275 million from 1980 to 2009. The highest 
	number was 14 million in one year, the lowest around 6 million in one year.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="layout-grid-mode: char; line-height: 150%; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 0">
<span style="font-size: 11.0pt; color: black">In order to implement the 
	one-child policy, many local government officials caused a lot of pregnant 
	women to die. In 2009, in Liaocheng, Shandong province, a 9-month pregnant 
	woman was forced to do abortion by local cadres. She and her baby died. In 
	Liuyang city, Hunan province, there was same case of forced abortion, in 
	that both mother and her baby died. In 2012, in Shaanxi province, Feng 
	Jianmei, a 7-month pregnant woman, was unable to pay a fine of 10,000 Yuan. 
	She was forced to do abortion. At last, her baby died besides the mother (3 
	November, <i>Ming Po</i>). These were tremendous inhuman cases.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="layout-grid-mode: char; line-height: 150%; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 0">
<span style="font-size: 11.0pt; color: black">For the last 35 years, the CPC 
	implemented one-child policy which sacrificed the happiness and lives of 
	many people. Now, in terms of enhancement of labor force, fulfillment of 
	production needs, lessening burden of aging problem, people are allowed to 
	have one more child. The State Council has approved the new policy. People 
	cannot decide how many children they can have. Yet, the people still have no 
	reproductive rights which are deprived by the state. This is another example 
	of the autocratic policies of the CPC.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="layout-grid-mode: char; line-height: 150%; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 0">
<span style="font-size: 11.0pt; color: black">In summary, there are many 
	barriers ahead of the implementation of the document. Most of the ideals 
	cannot be achieved. The improved measures are better than none, but they 
	cannot meet people’s desperate needs for livelihood and democracy.</span></p>
