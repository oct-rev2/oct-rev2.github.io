<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 11.0pt">Nuclear power plants are throughout 
the whole of Japan. Starting from the 1970s, Japan has adopted capitalist 
modernization, industrialization and urbanization which led to an enormous 
demand of energy. In order to reduce its dependency on imported oil, Japan built 
a lot nuclear power plants along its coastal areas. Fukushima, where the nuclear 
power plant caused a radioactive leak, is the base of manufacturing electronic 
chips and automobiles. China, named as ‘the world factory’ and ranked as the 
second largest economic entity surpassing Japan, should learn from Japan’s 
tragedy.</span></p>

<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 11.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On 16 March, Wen Jiabao, 
the Premier of the State Council, stressed that the government should examine 
rigidly the existing nuclear power plants, evaluate the new proposal of nuclear 
projects, formulate the regulation of the safety of nuclear energy, and improve 
the middle and long term planning. Before the approval of safety, all nuclear 
projects have to be suspended. According to the new statistics by the 
International Atomic Energy Agency, there are 37 nuclear power plants in 
progress in Asia, among which China has 26, most of them being situated along 
the coastal areas.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="layout-grid-mode: char; line-height: 200%">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 11.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to Wu Libo, 
researcher of Energy Economy and Strategy Research Center of Fudan University, 
nuclear power is only 1.12% of energy consumption of China. In fact, most energy 
supply comes from thermal power. Over the past 30 years of implementing the 
reform and open-door policy, China had speedily promoted market economy and 
consumerism which led to an increasing consumption of energy such as coal, crude 
oil, natural gas and hydropower. According to the statistics of China Automobile 
Industry Association, China has become the first largest automobile market 
because it has produced 13.791 million cars and it has purchased 13.6448 million 
cars at the end of 2009. Moreover, in 2007, in every 100 village families, there 
are 26.1 sets of refrigerators and 8.5 sets of air-conditioners. Meanwhile, in 
every 100 urban families, there are 95 sets of refrigerators and 
air-conditioners.</span></p>

<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 11.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand, severe 
drought has plagued the middle and lower streams of Yangtze River, which aroused 
a series of crises such as shortages of grain, electricity and water. On 18 May, 
Wen Jiabao pointed out that the Three Gorges Dam has yet to solve problems such 
as migrants’ stability, ecological environment, and disaster precautions. It 
also affects the shipway, irrigation and water supply of the middle and lower 
streams of Yangtze River. The Working Plan of Post-Three Gorges Dam Project 
stated that the total investment for the follow-up is RMB 123.89 billion. 
However, some data show that the project has used an investment of RMB 184.9 
billion at the end of 2009.</span></p>

<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 11.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to the Office of 
National Precautions of Flooding and Drought, up to mid May, the affected arable 
land was 98.12 million mu, mainly in provinces like Hubei, Gangsu, Jiangxi and 
Hunan. To a certain extent, the drought was not merely natural disaster. It is 
because some rivers and lakes were illegally dredged which led to the 
degradation of water level. And there are many dams built along the main rivers 
of provinces like Jiangxi, Hubei and Hunan. Wang Jingquan, an inspector of the 
Office of Flooding and Drought Precautions of Yangtze Water Committee, mentioned 
that in March and April, the Three Gorges Dam was just mainly for electricity 
generation. A Lot of water was used. This made the drought become worse and 
worse.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="layout-grid-mode: char; line-height: 200%">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 11.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Three Gorges Dam has 
become profit seeking through generating electricity. Moreover, Three Gorges of 
Yangtze Corporation and Yangtze Electricity Company set up Hubei Qingneng 
Property Group to make more profits through the speculation of property. They 
own 100% of shares of 6 real estate companies in Guangzhou, Hubei, Beijing and 
Zhuhai. In a word, Three Gorges of Yangtze Corporation has become a governmental 
enterprise which is largely involved in hydropower business and property 
speculation.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="layout-grid-mode: char; line-height: 200%">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 11.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In conclusion, if human 
beings still ignore the problems caused by modernization and the extraction of 
resources, and worse still, market economy and consumerism has become the only 
choice, the next generations will definitely suffer.</span></p>
