<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 11.0pt">in Beijing airport. Until 20 May, 
through Xinhua News Agency, the Chinese authorities stated that based on a 
primary investigation, Beijing Fake Cultural Development Limited, a company Ai 
controlled, evaded taxes and intentionally destroyed accounting documents. 
Hence, he was under house arrest (quoted from <i>Ming Po</i> dated 21 May).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 24.0pt; layout-grid-mode: char; line-height: 200%">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 11.0pt">These are false allegations and 
intentional punishment by the authorities. The legal representative of Beijing 
Fake Cultural Development Limited is Lu Qing, Ai’s wife. Hence, it should be Lu 
to be interrogated about tax evasion. Furthermore, although Ai has his own 
rights of meeting his spouse, his wife was allowed to visit him only 15 minutes 
on 15 May. Liu Xiaoyuan, Ai’s attorney, pointed out that house arrest outside 
one’s house is illegal. Ai could have his house arrest in his own legal living 
place. This is clearly written in the regulations of criminal cases. Liu also 
disclosed that Ai was restricted from free communication with the outside world. 
Furthermore, Liu refuted that legally speaking, if one goes to the taxation 
authority to settle tax evasion and to pay penalty fee, he is entitled to go 
home.</span></p>

<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 11.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the rule of the 
Chinese bureaucracy, there are numerous wrong cases. Ai is one of the victims. 
This has aroused sympathy from outside and inside China. In Europe, several 
sculpture exhibitions were held to request the Chinese authorities to release 
Ai. The editorial of </span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 11.0pt">
Southern Metropolis Daily</span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 11.0pt">, 
dated 12 May, euphemistically supported him that “we cannot do it better, so we 
present 12 iron animals and porcelain melon seeds which symbolize your condensed 
life”. Actually, ‘12 animals’ and ‘melon seeds’ are among Ai’s renowned 
sculptures. The editorial statement in the website was soon erased. The editor 
was assigned to another post.</span></p>

<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 11.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whenever the Chinese 
authorities violate the rights of freedom of speech and publication, they claim 
that everything is based on the law. This discloses that the authoritative 
bureaucracy is beyond the law. Chinese people can indeed enjoy real democracy 
only if this bureaucracy is removed.</span></p>

	On 22 June 2011, partly due to overseas and domestic pressure, the Chinese 
	legal authorities released Ai on bail, who had been in detention on charges 
	of tax evasion for 81 days. The state media claimed that he was willing to 
	pay any back taxes and his attitude in confessing his crimes was good. In 
	fact, Ai had suffered physically and mentally, so he was forced to confess. 
	And, Ai is not the supposed criminal even though the Chinese authorities
