Nuclear Disaster</span></b></p>

<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 11.0pt">On 11 March, following an 
earthquake and tsunami, Fukushima Nuclear Power Plant exploded. The disaster is 
ranked the most serious level, i.e., the seventh level. The surrounding area 
within 30 kilometers is contaminated by nuclear radiation. It is not apt for 
human beings to live there in 20 years. Economic loss was estimated to be over 
USD 300 billion. This has become the most serious disaster in the history of 
Japan. Large volumes of radioactive water were poured into the sea and polluted 
the ecological environment. The Tokyo Electricity Company optimistically 
estimated that nuclear leakage would stop at the end of 2011. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 24.0pt; layout-grid-mode: char; line-height: 200%">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 11.0pt">Previously, several serious nuclear 
disasters happened. For example, Three Mile Island accident of 1979 in 
Pennsylvania of the United States; Chernobyl disaster of 1986 in Ukraine, where 
steam explosion and meltdown led to the evacuation of 300,000 people and the 
dispersal of radioactive material across Europe; and in 1999, the disaster of 
Tokaimura uranium processing facility in Ibaraki Prefecture of Japan. According 
to Greenpeace, in the 57-year development history of nuclear power, 285 cases 
were classified no 2 or above in the scale of nuclear accident.</span></p>

<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 11.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Particularly after the 
Chernobyl disaster, more and more people oppose nuclear development and demand 
shutting down nuclear power plants. In 1986, the Chinese government declared to 
build a nuclear power plant near Daya Bay. 116 civil organizations joined 
together to form an alliance. They mobilized hundreds of thousands of people to 
sign a petition opposing the nuclear plant. Unfortunately, they failed to stop 
it. <i>October Review</i> of 1986 published several articles to declare its 
opposing position (see issues no 113-116, etc.).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="layout-grid-mode: char; line-height: 200%">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 11.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The official experts openly 
guarantee the safety of nuclear energy, but it is not convincing. Within 
Guangdong Province, there are already 10 nuclear power plants. Daya Bay nuclear 
power plant, with a distance of 50 kilometers from Hong Kong, was found to have 
a radioactive leak in 2010. According to Wen Hongjun, former director of 
Economic Professional Committee of China Nuclear Dynamics Organization, there 
are two potential risks in the nuclear industry: one, too many nuclear plants 
and people do not pay much attention to the operation; second, the quality of 
nuclear facility is questionable.</span></p>

<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 11.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Japan’s nuclear 
crisis, lots of people from all over the world have gone to demonstrations. For 
example, on 26 March, 100,000 people of Berlin demonstrated on the streets. On 
30 May, German government declared to close all nuclear plants by 2022.</span></p>

	<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 11.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All Hong Kong people 
	are close to several nuclear plants in Guangdong province. Once a 
	radioactive leak from any plant happens, no one can escape. Thus, Hong Kong 
	people should come together to oppose nuclear energy and request Chinese 
	government to stop the proliferation of nuclear plants. On the other hand, 
	it is necessary to develop renewable energy such as hydropower, wind power 
	and solar energy.</span></p>
