<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">This year, on 16 June, Zhang Kai 
wrote, “the sudden death of Li Wangyang, a committed activist of Democratic 
Movement of 1989, proves that the local bureaucracy ignores law and justice. The 
local authorities announced that Li hanged himself in the hospital. But there 
were many doubts. … The local authorities forced his sister to agree to quick 
cremation. This obviously violated the new Criminal Procedure Law that forbids 
forced confession and evidence elimination” (see “Postscript” of ‘</span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">Comments 
on China’s New Criminal Procedure Law</span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">’, 
Issue no. 232).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 24.0pt; layout-grid-mode: char; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 30px">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">Afterwards, the official 
authorities announced that Li Wangyang’s sister, Li Wangling and her husband, 
Zhao Bozhu, agreed to the autopsy report and signed, to apply for cremation, and 
to write an open letter stating there will be no further communication with the 
outside world.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 24.0pt; layout-grid-mode: char; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 30px">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">Nearly 100 days after the doubtful 
‘suicide’ of Li Wangyang, a reporter of <i>Ming Pao</i> broke through barriers 
to interview Li Wangling, Zhao Bozhu and Yin Zhengan (Li Wangyang’s good friend) 
in Shaoyang City of Hunan province. Zhao testified that they had not taken part 
in any investigation or signed any autopsy report of suicide. Their statements 
clearly contradicted the official reports.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 18.0pt; layout-grid-mode: char; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 30px">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">The report asked them if the signed 
documents were fake. Zhao replied that they were requested to sign something 
that looked like a medical report. “We saw it, but we did not understand those 
medical jargons … Anyway, we signed at last, but could we say no at that 
moment?” And, they declined that they wrote the open letter.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 24.0pt; layout-grid-mode: char; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 30px">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">During his visit, the reporter’s 
telephone was suspected to be tapped. Worse still, he was continuously 
interrogated by the police as he was in detention at the hotel for 44 hours. The 
authorities also arranged ‘an interview’ under the surveillance of officials. 
They brought Li, Zhao and Yin to the hotel, then asked the reporter to do an 
interview. The officials took the video-recording. Zhao was very nervous and 
said again, “don’t talk again any more the past” (quoted from <i>Ming Pao</i>, 
12 September).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 24.0pt; layout-grid-mode: char; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 30px">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">The above all shows that the 
authorities made fake documents, cheated the public, violated the law, and 
repeated mistakes.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 24.0pt; layout-grid-mode: char; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 30px">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">Professor Wang Youjin, a mainland 
legal expert, remarked that the statements of Li Wangling and her husband are 
key proofs, which fundamentally denied the official report. This already 
justified starting a new investigation.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 24.0pt; layout-grid-mode: char; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 30px">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">Despite the public challenges, 
Hunan provincial authority investigated the case and finally stated that Li 
Wangyang committed suicide. This showed that within the traditional bureaucracy, 
what the Shaoyang City authorities did was normal practice. But it violated the 
reporter’s human security and interview freedom and endangered press freedom. <i>
Ming Pao</i> strongly protested and complained to Hong Kong News Executives’ 
Association, HKSAR, Liaison Office of the Central People's Government (LOCPG), 
and Hong Kong and Macao Office of the State Council of PRC. They required the 
Central government to investigate into the 44-hour detention of two reporters 
and guaranteed that it would not happen again.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 24.0pt; layout-grid-mode: char; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 30px">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">Despite its stance of pro-Beijing, 
Hong Kong Federation of Journalists expressed the same concerns to LOCPG which 
later replied that they would direct Hong Kong opinions and requests to the 
mainland authorities. Lee Cheuk-Yan, chairman of </span><span class="st">

in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China</span></span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">, 
went to Geneva to see the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights. He submitted at 
least 20 reports of Li Wangyang’s case prepared by Hong Kong organizations and 
council members, in order to draw international attention, to require Chinese 
government to conduct an investigation with independence and justice, to punish 
the officials who violated the law, to compensate Li’s family, and to take 
precautions against relevant crimes.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="layout-grid-mode: char; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 30px">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We completely support the 
above requests. We also request that the Chinese government must immediately 
disclose the truth of Li Wangyan’s death, ensure human security and freedom 
speech of Li Wangling, Zhao Zhubo, and lawyers, and guarantee that they will not 
be suppressed afterwards.</span></p>
