<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">On 8 November 2012, Hu Jintao 
presented a report, entitled “Firmly March on the Road of Socialism with Chinese 
Characteristics and Strive to Complete the Building of a Moderately Prosperous 
Society in All Respects” in the 18<sup>th</sup> National Congress of the 
Communist Party of China. He appealed to the capitalist countries that China has 
implemented market economy for over the past 30 years. In fact, China has 
legalized the protection of private property, which led to the enlarging gap 
between the rich and the poor, social conflicts, class polarizations and 
struggles. There are escalating tensions between party cadres and ordinary 
people. These are the inevitable consequences of China’s adopting of a 
capitalist road. If it is what socialism with Chinese characteristics means, 
then it implies that socialism with Chinese characteristics equals to 
capitalism, and contradicts obviously Marxist Socialism.</span></p>

<b><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">China under the rule of Hu and 
Wen</span></b></p>

<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">When Hu took power, he urged that 
CPC should adopt ‘people-centered’ policy, bear people in mind, and fulfill what 
people desperately need. But he has not carried out what he promised during his 
rule. Every year, he repeated the same things: “</span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">we 
must be keenly aware that there is still much room for improvement in our work 
and there are a lot of difficulties and problems on our road ahead. They include 
the following: Unbalanced, uncoordinated and unsustainable development remains a 
big problem. </span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">… </span>
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">Many systemic barriers stand in the 
way of promoting development in a scientific way. The tasks of deepening reform 
and opening up and changing the growth model remain arduous. The development gap 
between urban and rural areas and between regions is still large, and so are 
income disparities. </span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">… </span>
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">Some community-level Party 
organizations are weak and lax. </span>
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">…</span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">Some 
sectors are prone to corruption and other misconduct, and the fight against 
corruption remains a serious challenge for us. We must take these difficulties 
and problems very seriously and work harder to resolve them.</span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%; layout-grid-mode: char; margin-top: 30pt">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to maintain social 
stability, China has spent tremendous money. Social instability, embedded in 
popular discontents, is exactly a consequence of promoting autocratic, 
bureaucratic and capitalist system by CPC. Whenever the premier Wen Jiabo 
proposed for limited political reform, he was rejected by the conservatives 
within the Party, as it would destroy the political and economic privileges of 
the bureaucratic interest blocs.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%; layout-grid-mode: char; margin-top: 30pt">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In section 5 of Hu’s 
report, it states that “</span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt; color: black">we 
should separate government administration from the management of enterprises, 
state assets, public institutions, and social organizations</span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">”. 
But it does not mean that the Party should separate from government 
administration. So the Party is still in super power and the Party cadres can do 
whatever they like. Although the people are supposed to be ‘the master of the 
country’ who own the power of supervision, it is only true on paper.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%; layout-grid-mode: char; margin-top: 30pt">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, what Chinese people 
urgently need most is political democratic reform. During the 18<sup>th</sup> 
National Congress of CPC, official media such as the Community of Powerful 
Country of People’s Net conducted a survey on top ten social issues of concern. 
The result showed that the first was “democratic politics”, 32.4%, followed by 
others such as ‘anti-corruption’, ‘social livelihood’, and ‘economic 
development’.[1] It is reasonable as it is proved by people’s truthful 
experiences. The social problems have led to more and more massive struggles. 
The number increased from 58,000 cases in 2003, to 90,000 cases in 2008. 
Afterwards, there was no more official record. But according to Professor Sun 
Liping of Tsinghua University, there must be at least 180,000 cases in 2010. [2]</span></p>

<b><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">After Xi Jinping took power</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%; layout-grid-mode: char; margin-top: 30pt">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the 18<sup>th</sup> 
National Congress, Xi Jinping was elected to be the general secretary of CPC and 
the chairman of CPC Central Military Commission. He declared that “empty talk is 
useless, only hard work can achieve the revival of a nation”. It seems that he 
will not give any empty talk. He also said that China would continue the policy 
of reform and open door, but there should be new explorations. Moreover, he 
claimed that it must fight against corruption, “if corruption gets worse, it 
will undoubtedly kill the party and ruin the whole country”, “do not think of 
making profit by being an official, and even take privileges by abusing power, 
as bureaucracy will be an absolute outcome.” He takes a strong stance on party 
governance, “no organization or anybody can be above the constitution and law”. 
However, this kind of privilege has existed for a long time. Everybody knows it. 
If he cannot abolish it, that means he gives empty talk as well.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%; layout-grid-mode: char; margin-top: 30pt">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Actually, corruption is 
very serious in today’s China. Anti-corruption implies that officials have to 
challenge their own interest groups. The situation gets worse even though some 
CPC leaders and resolutions made several anti-graft calls. A few corrupt 
officials were punished as they became losers in the power game. Particularly 
when capitalism becomes prevalent, officials and businessmen conspire, and lots 
of cadres become businessmen, the anti-graft campaign would obtain no 
achievement. The newly elected leadership laid out some concrete anti-graft 
policies and punished a number of corrupt officials. But corruption is 
everywhere and becomes institutionalized. Only if the whole bureaucracy and its 
privileges are completely destroyed, the people of the whole country can be the 
real masters.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%; layout-grid-mode: char; margin-top: 30pt">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Xi claimed that he 
continued to adopt the policy of capitalist market economy which led to problems 
such as conspiracy of officials and businessmen and corruption getting serious. 
In that sense, China will become unstable and CPC needs to pay a high cost of 
maintaining social stability.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%; layout-grid-mode: char; margin-top: 30pt">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He mentioned about ‘new 
explorations’ but he has not talked about the concrete contents after one month 
in office. Later, d</span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">uring his 
visit to Guangdong, Xi called on the entire Party and people from all ethnic 
groups to unswervingly adhere to the path of reform and opening up</span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">,</span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt"> 
and put greater focus on pursuing reform in a more systematic, integrated and 
coordinated way. Xi vowed no stop in reform, and no stop in opening up. </span>
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">Xi urged to work hard to build the 
moderately prosperous society and to push forward socialist modernization.
<span style="color: black">He stressed that CPC </span></span>
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt; color: black">should dare to tackle 
difficulties and venture along dangerous paths to break through barriers to 
reform presented by ideological differences and vested interests</span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt; color: black">.[3]</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%; layout-grid-mode: char; margin-top: 30pt">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">Will Xi’s new calls and promises 
come true? Particularly can the last statement be carried out and not be empty 
talk? We do not have any illusion about this. Let the people wait and see.</span></p>
