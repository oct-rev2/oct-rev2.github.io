<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">In 1989, Chinese students and 
workers fought against the authoritative bureaucracy and corruption, for 
democracy and human rights. The struggle had been brutally suppressed, but over 
the past 21 years, the reality has shown us that it is essential to continue the 
struggle. It has also adversely proven that the repression has exacerbated the 
many abuses in the aftermath of the repression.</span></p>

<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 24.0pt; line-height: 14.0pt">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">It is evident that, although the 
Chinese government has claimed that it is necessary to combat corruption, the 
situation is gradually deteriorating and now it has become the most serious 
social problem.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 24.0pt; line-height: 14.0pt">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">According to a survey, 60% of 
interviewees consider that official corruption is the problem causing the most 
damages to the national reputation in 2009. It ranked first on the list in the 
past consecutive three years. The number of interviewees is the largest one 
recently, which shows that common people are discontented about the issue (1).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 24.0pt; line-height: 14.0pt">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">Similarly, as the surveys conducted 
by the official media like People’s Daily and People’s Net state, 
anti-corruption ranks top on the list of public concerns, and the gap between 
the rich and the poor, and the control of the price of property estates rank the 
second and the third, replacing food security and medical reform in 2009 (2).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 24.0pt; line-height: 14.0pt">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">According to the statistics, in 
2009, more than 19 provincial officials stepped down due to corruption, which is 
the largest number in recent years. Among those, we find some well-known names 
such as Huang Songyou, the Deputy Head of the Supreme People’s Court, Zheng 
Shaodong, assistant to the Head of the Ministry of Public Security, Wang Huayuan, 
the General Secretary of Chinese Communist Party in Zhejiang Province, and the 
chairmen of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference in Guangdong 
Province, Shandong Province and Guizhou Province.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 24.0pt; line-height: 14.0pt">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">The statistics are incomplete as 
they only refer to some of the corrupt and stepped-down officials. There are 
still numerous corrupt officials remaining in power.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 24.0pt; line-height: 14.0pt">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">In March 2010, Cao Jianming, the 
Head of Supreme People’s Procuratorate, reported to the National Congress that 
in 2009, the number of cases of commercial bribes and crimes committed mainly by 
officials was 10,218, with 18,191 cases of corruption, and 2,670 division heads 
were involved. Both the number of cases and the people involved have increased 
over the previous year.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 24.0pt; line-height: 14.0pt">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">In early 2010, Li Changchun, the 
head of Supreme People’s Procuratorate of Zhoukou Municipal of Henan Province, 
was suspected of taking advantage of billions of money of the Committee on Basic 
Infrastructure, and then was under detention and interrogation. It is another 
case of corrupt officials in the juridical system.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 24.0pt; line-height: 14.0pt">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">The government announced that it 
has fought corruption, but in reality, corruption is still rampant. For example, 
recently, both the national and local sessions of the National People’s Congress 
and the People’s Political Consultative Conference have been criticized for huge 
expenditure and exploitation of intensive labor, and this phenomenon is 
challenged even by the official media that call for change in the practice. The 
media in the mainland once estimated that the expenditure on food, accommodation 
and transport for the representatives of the sessions of the two congresses 
every year is at least over 100 million yuan. This year every deputy is given a 
free notebook, so the total direct expenditure will be 127 million yuan (3).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 24.0pt; line-height: 14.0pt">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">After attending the sessions, 5,224 
deputies and committee members can take away the notebooks. The public is 
outrageous about this kind of ‘generosity’ as it abuses public money. Some 
scholars point out that in this sense, the deputies are corrupt in another way, 
under a beautiful name (4).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 24.0pt; line-height: 14.0pt">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">Officials of the administration 
system, or Chinese Communist Party members, are not only corrupt in everyday 
life, they also take advantage of their authority for making profits. There is a 
sharp increase of personal wealth. Many cadres get involved in doing business 
and then become one part of the Red Capitalists.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 14.0pt">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In big contrast, the 
majority of the working class has yet to share the fruits of the economic 
growth.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 24.0pt; line-height: 14.0pt">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">Over many years in the past, 
China’s economy has rapidly increased with 8% or above, but the proportion of 
labor income in the GDP has continuously dropped for the last 22 years. It fell 
from 56.5% in 1983 to 36.7% in 2005, which was almost a decrease of 20%. In 
contrast, the proportion of capital income in the GDP has increased by 20%. 
According to a recent survey by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, 23.4% 
of workers have obtained no increase in their wages for the last five years. 
75.2% of workers thought that the current social distribution of income was 
unfair. 61% of workers considered that workers were comparatively low paid, 
which was the most serious social injustice.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 24.0pt; line-height: 14.0pt">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">Zhang Jianguo, the head of 
Department of Collective Contract of All-China Federation of Trade Unions, 
pointed out that in recent years there have been a series of extreme cases of 
mass events caused by contradictions between capital and labor. The essential 
causes are low income and little benefit. Based on an unfinished two-year 
statistics, capital-labor disputes caused by problems of income distribution, 
social benefits and insurance has counted for 65% of cases, which is an 
important factor of endangering social stability (5).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 24.0pt; line-height: 14.0pt">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">Even the high ranking officials of 
the Chinese official trade union publicly recognize the problem. As there were 
serve discontents among the masses, it could be understood that the national 
union was under great pressure.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 14.0pt">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now in China, the disparity 
of the rich and the poor is very serious. Some scholars stated that the gap 
between 10% of the population with the highest income and 10% of the population 
with the lowest income has increased from 7.3 times in 1988 to 23 times in 2007 
(6). This is why this issue becomes the second public concern, according to the 
survey reported by People’s Net. The workers are comparatively low paid which 
exacerbates social contradictions.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 24.0pt; line-height: 14.0pt">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">In reality, the mass incidents of 
capital-labor disputes are increasing (even if they are labeled as ‘extreme 
cases’ by the government).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 14.0pt">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 2008, the author quoted 
a news report from <i>Ming Pao</i>, dated 15 March 2008, that ‘according to the 
statistics of the Committee of Enterprises and Coordination of
<a name="OLE_LINK7">All-China Federation of Trade Unions</a>, there were 406,000 
cases of capital-labor disputes in 2007. The figure did not include the 
statistics of Ministry of Labor and Social Security and the juridical system. 
Zhang Mingqi, the vice chairman of All-China Federation of Trade Unions, 
disclosed that the number of capital-labor disputes rapidly spiraled, with an 
annual rate of 20% (for the details, please see <a name="OLE_LINK18"><i>October 
Review</i>, No. 224</a>).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 24.0pt; line-height: 14.0pt">
<a name="OLE_LINK11"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">In March 2010, 
Wang Shenghou, the head of Supreme People’s Court, also publicly reported that 
in 2009, the courts at different levels have handled 317,000 cases of 
labor-capital disputes, with an increase of 10.8%.</span></a></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 14.0pt">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 2008, according to the

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 24.0pt; line-height: 14.0pt">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">In some places, the working class 
used strikes to fight for wage increase and better working conditions. But some 
workers were desperate and committed suicide due to bad working conditions and 
always being under great working pressure. In </span>
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt; color: black">Foxconn</span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">, 
a Taiwanese enterprise in Shenzhen, within four months, from 23 January to 26 
May, 12 workers had committed suicide by jumping off the building, causing 10 
deaths and 2 injured.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 24.0pt; line-height: 14.0pt">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">The enterprise is a typical 
capitalist corporation. There is rigid management of production, tightly 
controlling the workers. Its management is criticized for inhumane and high 
exploitation. Workers are considered as machines, without privacy in daily life. 
They are exhausted out of 12 working hours daily. The wages are merely around 
RMB 1000 but they always have to do overtime work. There is hierarchy within the 
corporation. The management do not pay respect to the workers, and always scold 
at and insult the workers. Worse still, the relationships among the workers are 
indifference. They not only have to endure the pressure of production, but also 
to work with such indifferent human relationships. All these led to the feelings 
of powerlessness, hopelessness and despair among the workers. Not surprisingly, 
some of them committed suicide.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 24.0pt; line-height: 14.0pt">

</span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt; color: black">Foxconn</span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt"> 
workers are only an iceberg of the plight of workers in China. Behind the 
booming economic growth of China, there exist plights and struggles of workers 
at the sweatshops.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 24.0pt; line-height: 14.0pt">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">The suicides also disclose the 
deeply rooted social contradictions. On the other hand, some innocent people 
were murdered out of any particular reason. Particularly, there were murder 
cases happening in primary schools, due to bitter anger and revenge. From late 
March to mid May, there happened six cases of killings, leading to nearly 100 
casualties.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 24.0pt; line-height: 14.0pt">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">Professor Hu Xingdou of Beijing 
Polytechnics University claimed that there were two reasons of social violence: 
one, the marginal and vulnerable social groups do not have access to make their 
complaints and appeals recognized; two, the mindset of taking revenge on society 
by the lowest stratum of society, through victimizing the most vulnerable 
groups.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 14.0pt">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 24.0pt; line-height: 14.0pt">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">In addition, there are numerous 
cases of “people getting insane out of official oppression”. In July 2009, a 
rural woman from Shaoxing Municipal of Zhejiang Province was under detention 
after making an appeal about demolishment. Her house was demolished by the 
township government. Her daughter-in-law was too shocked and then became 
mentally disordered. Moreover, Ma Jiwen, a peasant from Luliang Muncipal of 
Shanxi Province, appealed that his land was invaded. It turned out that the 
court sent him to jail based on “his crime of blackmailing the government”. If 
the conflicts between the government officials and ordinary people cannot be 
solved, there will appear more and more social violence.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 24.0pt; line-height: 14.0pt">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">After several cases of violent 
attacks on children, Wen Jiabao, the Premier of the State Council, stated that 
the government not only has to strengthen the security, but also to solve the 
underlying problems of social violence, such as to tackle social contradictions 
and disputes, as well as to reinforce the function of coordination at the ground 
level.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 14.0pt">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Being one of the top rulers 
of the country, the Premier would clearly understand the social situation and 
the origins of social conflicts. This is caused by the bureaucracy system which 
enables the bureaucrats to abuse the political and economic privileges and 
become corrupt. They adopt the path of capitalism which causes exploitation of 
workers, social polarization, the disparities between the rich and the poor, 
widespread unemployment, and escalating price of property estates. In addition, 
many government policies have worsened the situation. Therefore, if one wants to 
solve the above problems effectively, one should change the existing bureaucracy 
system completely.</span></p>
