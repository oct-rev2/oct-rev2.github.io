<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 13.0pt">The rampant 
development of capitalism under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party 
has led to increasingly acute sufferings by the people. During the period of the 
People’s Congress and the Consultative Committee meetings in spring, many 
reports about the adverse effects of the current state policies surfaced. The

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 13.0pt">In a survey, 
the most profitable business of 2005 was that of the medical system. Hospitals 
and clinics are reaping huge profits. For example, antibiotics is </span>
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 13.0pt">sold by the pharmaceutical factory</span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 13.0pt"> 
at a </span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 13.0pt">price</span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 13.0pt"> 
of 12 yuan, but sold in the hospital at 170 yuan, with a profit of 13 times. The 
hospital price is normally tens of times more than market retail prices. 
Statistics show a high increase in the proportion of medical expenses in 
household expenses. As reported by <i>Wen Hui Bao</i>, while peasants’ net 
income since 1980 has increased by about 30 times, and wages of urban workers 
have increased by about 20 times, </span>
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 13.0pt">the proportion of </span>
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 13.0pt">medical expenses in household 
expenses have increased by 122 times. Statistics from the Health Ministry 
indicate that 48.9% of sick people in the country do not see a doctor, as they 
should do, and 29.6% of the sick who should be hospitalized are not 
hospitalized. Of the urban poor, 30% fall into the category of the poor due to 
illness.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 13.0pt">There are 
astounding stories of how hospitals reap huge profits. The CCTV reported on 21 
Nov 2005 a case of a cancer patient staying in a hospital in Harbin for 67 days, 
and billed for 5.5 million yuan. In over 70 % of hospitals in China have 
occurred disputes between patients and the hospitals about the medical costs. 
The 2005 report of the State Auditing Department has it that of the 10 hospitals 
under the Health Ministry and in Beijing randomly selected for investigation, in 
2003, over 20 million yuan excess of medical fees and drugs fees were </span>
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 13.0pt">charged</span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 13.0pt">.<a name="_ednref2" title href="#_edn2"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[2]</span></span></a> 
It is reported that of the 9 million blind cases in China, 6 million should have 
been curable, for example, cataract cases. However, the lack of funds and 
facilities has resulted in the lack of treatment for the patients.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 13.0pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<h1><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 13.0pt">Education</span></h1>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 13.0pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 13.0pt">Another 
serious problem that has come up in recent years is the tuition fees for 
tertiary education. Before the Reform of 1979, tertiary education was free. 20 
years ago, it was increased to 200 yuan. In 1995, it was 800 yuan. In 2005, it 
was increased to 5</span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 13.0pt">,</span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 13.0pt">000 
yuan. Hence, within 20 years, the increase was 25 times.<a name="_ednref3" title href="#_edn3"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[3]</span></span></a> 
It is reported that university undergraduates with financial difficulties number 
about 2.4 million, which is 20% of the student population. Students with serious 
financial difficulties are around 5-10% of the student population. While the 
average proportion of education expenses in the GDP </span>
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 13.0pt">in the world </span>
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 13.0pt">was 4.8% in 1998, in China, the 
proportion has been 2.5%-3.5%. An official from the Education Ministry said that 
it takes about 400 billion yuan to maintain the normal operation of the tertiary 
education sector, but state input is only 80 billion yuan. The bank loan</span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 13.0pt">s 
to</span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 13.0pt"> the tertiary education 
sector ha</span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 13.0pt">ve</span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 13.0pt"> 
exceeded 100 billion yuan, and the difference has to be made up by tuition fees. 
Surveys show that university students with rural background ha</span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 13.0pt">ve</span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 13.0pt"> 
dropped from former 60-70%, to the present 30%.<a name="_ednref4" title href="#_edn4"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[4]</span></span></a> 
It is also reported that </span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 13.0pt">in 
primary and secondary schools, </span>
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 13.0pt">rural children have a high drop out 
rate. There is a discrepancy between the official figure and those from surveys. 
The Party Central School conducted a sur</span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 13.0pt">v</span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 13.0pt">ey 
in 2004 in 16 provincial cities. For example, the Jiutai Middle School of Bin 
Xian, Heilongjiang Province, reported of a 2% attrition rate, yet the survey 
found out that the rate was 8%.<a name="_ednref5" title href="#_edn5"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[5]</span></span></a></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 13.0pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 13.0pt">To keep 
operation with an inadequate input from the state funds, schools have resorted 
to extorting money from the students. Since 2000, excessive educational fees 
have remained at the top of complaint reports. In 2005, over 13,000 cases of 
such complaints have been investigated into by the authorities.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 13.0pt">One of the 
nine most profitable businesses in 2005 was the property market. Local 
authorities have been involved in grabbing land from the peasants or the 
residents, and the property market prices have soared. At the same time, the 
poverty situation is still serious. The Director of the State Council Poverty 
Alleviation Department said that the annual grain consumption of poor households 
was a per capita 75 kgs, which is on the subsistence level. Among 592 key 
counties for poverty alleviation, 332 suffer from inadequate food, which 
involves about 130 million people. China’s poor population numbers second in the 
world, coming after India. There are still 23.65 million people in rural China 
that have not resolved their food shortage problem, and low income poor 
population numbers 40.67 million.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 13.0pt">While there is 
still a substantial low income population, with social polarization, the rich in 
China is also rising. Some statistics show that in 2003, 236,000 people own 
financial assets of over US$ 1 million. Their total wealth exceeds US$ 969 
billion. China’s GDP in 2003 was US$ 1,400 billion.<a name="_ednref6" title href="#_edn6"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[6]</span></span></a> 
Less than 0.5% of the households own over 60% of the country’s wealth, and about 
70% of this 0.5% households hold an asset of over US$ half a million. For 
comparison, in the USA, 5% of the population owns 59.2% of the country’s wealth.<a name="_ednref7" title href="#_edn7"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[7]</span></span></a></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 13.0pt">According to 
the statistics announced by the State Structural Reform Committee, the lowest 
20% of urban population owns only 2.75% of the urban income. It amounts to only 
4.6% of the income of the top 20% of the urban population.<a name="_ednref8" title href="#_edn8"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[8]</span></span></a></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 13.0pt">With social 
polarization, crimes are becoming rampant, and the sense of security of the 
population has been on the decline. According to the statistics announced by the 
Beijing Public Security Bureau on 17 Nov 2005, in January to September 2005, 
crime cases reported to public security bureaus all over the country numbered 
47.8 million, a rise of over 20% compared to the previous year. This means a 
daily number of 170,000 cases. In March 2006, the report by the Supreme People’s 
Court to the National People’s Congress had it that local criminal courts had 
completed a total of 683,997 first trial cases, and 844,717 persons were 
convicted. Completed cases on serious crimes such as explosions, intentional 
murders, robberies, rapes, kidnaps and mafia numbered 238,738, and criminals 
convicted numbered 321,395 persons. According to a mafia study specialist from 
Nanjing University, the mafia in China number at least 1 million.<a name="_ednref9" title href="#_edn9"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[9]</span></span></a>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 13.0pt">While there 
are more crimes, social polarization has also induced more revolts and protests 
from the population. According to the “Social Blue Paper” published in 2005, the 
officially named “mass incidents” numbered from 10,000 cases in 1993 to 60,000 
cases in 2003, and the number of people that participated in these incidents 
increased from around 730,000 to 3.07 million. In 2005, mass incidents increased 
to 87,000 cases.<a name="_ednref10" title href="#_edn10"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[10]</span></span></a> 
According to the Public Security Bureau, 74,000 mass incidents occurred in 2004, 
an increase of over 6 times as compared to 10,000 cases in 1994, with 3.76 
million people participating. The causes for the incidents were, according to 
the authorities, capital-labour relations, acquisition of rural land, urban 
demolitions and removals, enterprise restructuring, and compensation for 
displaced people.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 13.0pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 13.0pt">Apart from 
mass protests and actions, many people have resorted to the spaces in the 
internet to voice their grievances and discontent. Before the premier Wen Jiabao 
was to call a press conference, several official and commercial websites 
organized cyberspace forums “I have a question for the Premier”. According to 
some statistics, about half a million web visitors posted their views on issues 
ranging from corruption, health, education, rural issues and social 
contradictions.<a name="_ednref11" title href="#_edn11"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[11]</span></span></a></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 13.0pt">Thus, though 
China’s economic growth seems spectacular, with an annual growth rate of 9.5% in 
the last five years, reaching a per capita GDP of over 13,000 yuan in 2005, a 
financial revenue of 3,000 billion yuan, and a foreign currency reserve of US 
dollars 853.7 billion, surpassing Japan to become number one in the world, 
however, in terms of the daily life of the general population for education, 
health, housing and livelihood, there is little state input, and the burden 
weighs on the general population. Without changing the basic line of 
marketization and some key policies, the minor funding allocations for poverty 
alleviation or cancellation of rural tariffs cannot be of much help. It can be 
seen that the primary cause of the difficulties for people’s lives is not only 
the wrong policies and lines, but also the political regime. The political 
system has to be radically transformed in a democratic way in order to bring 
forward a radical resolution of the burdens on the people. Not the “steady, 
orderly political reform” advocated by Hu Jintao, the General Secretary of the 
Chinese Communist Party, in his speech on 21 April 2006!</span></p>
