<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 10.5pt">In 2004, under public pressure, the 
Chinese government firstly added the terms that “the Government should pay 
respect to and protect human rights” to the Constitution. It was merely on 
paper. In reality, people were repressed whenever they attempted to defend human 
rights. It repeated what Mao Zedong did in the 1950s, during which many people 
were purged due to their critiques of government policy. Nowadays, both central 
and local bureaucracies are corrupt, which leads to large numbers of people 
being wronged. The innocent people cannot have legal protection. Many lawyers 
and dissidents courageously stand up and fight for human rights. Unfortunately, 
they were illegally arrested, with the criminal charges of “creating troubles”, 
“disrupting social order”, “and endangering national security”. Many were sent 
to prison for several years and even more than a decade. For example, Liu Xiaobo, 
the founder of Chapter 08, was given a verdict of 11-year imprisonment. He is 
still in prison now.</span></p>

<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 10.5pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A lot of dissidents and 
lawyers of human rights have suffered in the prison. For example, in Sichuan 
Province, several people defending human rights have not been released yet, 
except Tan Zuoren who was previously sent to prison due to his investigation of 
jerry-built projects at Sichuan Earthquake on May Twelfth. Li Liqian, the leader 
defending human rights after Sichuan Earthquake, disclosed that officials 
misappropriated compensation for earthquake victims. He then was accused of 
“assembling a crowd to disrupt social order” with 3-year imprisonment. He is 
supposed to be released in 2015. Moreover, Chen Wei, who attended June-Fourth 
Democratic Movement and organized signature campaign for Chapter 08, was accused 
of “subverting the state” with 14-year imprisonment. He will be released in 
2020. Liu Xianbin, who formed China Democratic Party and criticized the 
jerry-built projects, was accused of “subverting the state” and others. His 
imprisonment term is 25 years and 6 months. He will be released in 2020. Xu 
Zhiyong, the founder of New Civil Movement, who demanded officials to disclose 
the information of their properties, as well as Guo Feixiong, the famous human 
rights defender, were arrested in July and August 2013. Three supporting people 
who come from Xinyu City, Jiangxi Province, were sent to jail for 3 to 6.5 
years. Pu Zhiqiang, lawyer of human rights, helped Tang Hui, woman who 
petitioned, and attended a seminar on June-Fourth, was arrested for “creating 
troubles” in May. His defense lawyer and friend were also under arrest. Xie 
Wenfei, Luo Xiangyang, Xiucaijianghu, Yang Chong, Zhang Wanhe, who are human 
rights defenders from Guangdong province, were all accused of “creating 
troubles” and detained. There is no latest information. On 20 June, Tang Jinling, 
human rights defender from Guangzhou, was arrested for “subverting the state”. 
Jiang Yanfang, Tang’s wife, said that “the charge is like a bag which covers 
every crime”.</span></p>

<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 10.5pt">Recently, in Beijing, Xu Youyu, Hao 
Jian, Pu Zhiqiang, Hu Shigeng and Liu Di had organized a seminar on June-Fourth 
in a private residential place, then they were all arrested for “creating 
troubles”. This caught international attention. Eight famous scholars such as 
Andrew James Nathan (USA), Perry Link (USA), Jean-Phillippe B</span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: PMingLiU">&eacute;</span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 10.5pt">ja 
(France) and Michel Bonnin (France), wrote an open letter to Xi Jinping, the 
President of China, urging the authorities to correct a mistake, and to release 
the recently arrested people. The letter said that when China has become a world 
power, some citizens are illegally arrested. This not only damages China’s world 
image, but also causes unease and misunderstandings. In addition, the letter is 
concerned about the secret arrest of Gao Yu, independent senior journalist who 
was accused of disclosing state secrets. The letter said, “after the end of the 
Cultural Revolution, there was the basic rule of the separation of party and 
government. Why does a document of the party become a secret of the state?” 
(quoted from<i> Mingpo</i>, dated 16 May).</span></p>

<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 10.5pt">In recent years, the repression of 
Chinese government on dissidents and lawyers reveals its anxiety about the 
unstable political situation. Although a huge amount of money is spent on 
maintaining national security, conflicts between the governing and the governed 
escalate and erupt, such as the terrorist attacks by Xinjiang Independence 
Movement in Tiananmen Square and other places. The attackers attempted to resist 
ethnic repression and to fight for the autonomous rights of ethnic minorities 
through violence. There are lots of outbreaks of large-scale demonstrations, 
such as refusing the construction of chemical plants and furnaces, fighting for 
the improvement of workers’ conditions, against the demolishment of housing, 
land expropriation and displacement by local residents, hawkers opposing the 
unreasonable oppression and arrest by urban management. </span></p>

<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 10.5pt">Not long ago, freedoms of speech, 
publication and press are restricted. An unreasonable order of “Seven Forbidden 
Topics” is issued. On 18 June, the State Administration of Press, Publication, 
Radio, Film and Television issued a notice to prohibit any branch or department 
of any media institution from news reports, on crossing their own area or 
boundary. Moreover, any journalist or branch is not allowed to make their own 
critical reports without any permission of the working unit. This has aroused 
controversy on the internet. To forbid a journalist to make criticism means to 
forbid his or her innate responsibility. </span></p>
