<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 10.5pt">In March 2008, Wen Jiabao, Premier 
of the State Council, presented the government report to the People’s Congress 
meeting, and stressed China’s remarkable achievements since the Reform and 
modernization efforts:</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: 17.95pt; line-height: 11.0pt">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 10.5pt">In terms of economic development, 
China’s gross national product reached RMB 2.466 trillion yuan, an increase of 
65.5% from 2002, at an annual growth rate of 10.6%. China has moved from the 6<sup>th</sup> 
to the 4<sup>th</sup> biggest economy in the world; the national revenue was 513 
billion yuan, and foreign currency reserve was over USD 152 billion.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: 17.95pt; line-height: 11.0pt">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 10.5pt">In terms of grain production, for 
four consecutive years, grain production had increased, reaching over 50 billion 
kgs.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: 17.95pt; line-height: 11.0pt">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 10.5pt">In terms of trade and finances, the 
total import and export value reached USD 217 billion, rising from the 6<sup>th</sup> 
to the 3<sup>rd</sup> in the world.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: 17.95pt; line-height: 11.0pt">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 10.5pt">However, at the press conference 
after delivering the Report, Wen Jiabao said: “This year is likely to be most 
difficult for the Chinese economy due to price hikes and high inflation.” It 
would not be easy to control CPI within 4.8%. China’s economy could not escape 
being affected by the sub prime rate crisis in the USA, the deflation of the US 
dollar, the high oil prices, and the massive vacillations of the global stock 
market. So, the difficulty for the Chinese economy lies in the many 
uncertainties both outside and inside China, leading to difficulties in policy 
making.</span><a name="_ednref1" title href="#_edn1"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[1]</span></span></a><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 10.5pt">
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: 17.95pt; line-height: 11.0pt">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 10.5pt">This is certainly contradictory, 
for while China’s economy seems to be doing very well, the greatest difficulties 
are taking place. This is an indication of the ineffectiveness and inadequacies 
of macro regulatory policies by the party in power, when the economy following 
the logic of the market gets out of hand.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: 17.95pt; line-height: 11.0pt">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 10.5pt">According to the Director of the 
State Statistics Bureau, while GDP increased by 11.4%, CPI of 2007 increased by 
4.8%, the highest in the last 11 years; the major factors were price increases 
in food (rising by 12.3%) and housing (by 4.5% in general, and by 7.6% in 70 big 
and medium cities). All social strata have been concerned with inflation. 
Entering 2008, the situation has gone for the worse. It was reported that CPI 
for the first two months of 2008 had increased by 8.7%.</span><a name="_ednref2" title href="#_edn2"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[2]</span></span></a><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 10.5pt"> 
In January alone, food prices increased by 18.7%, with pork rising by 57%, 
poultry and meat by 30-40%, vegetables by 13.7%, and fruits by 10.3%.</span><a name="_ednref3" title href="#_edn3"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[3]</span></span></a></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: 17.95pt; line-height: 11.0pt">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 10.5pt">Zhong Dajun, economist in Beijing, 
said that the CPI index published by the State Statistics Bureau was not 
reflecting the actual situation of price rises. The CPI as felt by the general 
people in China in the last two years would be of two digits, and the situation 
resembled the eve of June 4, 1989, though at that time, domestic factors were 
prominent, and now, there are intricate factors of the global economy, hence the 
developments would be even more unpredictable. Zhong Dajun pointed out that one 
major reason for the inflation was the flow of global hot money into China. It 
amounted to about USD 500 billion in 2007. He argued that the politicization of 
the question of the rise in the value of the RMB has caused a lot of hot money 
to come into China, and the authorities need to print more and more RMB notes in 
response, hence there is the accelerating inflation in China.<a name="_ednref4" title href="#_edn4"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[4]</span></span></a></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: 17.95pt; line-height: 11.0pt">
<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 10.5pt">In March, there are reports of not 
only rising food costs of 11% compared to the last month, but also shortages in 
fuel supplies in cities like Guangzhou and Wuhan.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: 17.95pt; line-height: 11.0pt">
<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 10.5pt">One by-product of the capitalist 
market is social polarization. The Gini coefficient in China has risen from 0.16 
before the Reform to the current 0.47. New middle classes have grown, and they 
are mostly from non-public ownership economic systems and freelance 
professionals. It is estimated that there are about 75 million people 
controlling or managing about 10 trillion yuan, and they contribute about 
one-third of the tariffs. It is expected that by 2010, they will contribute to 
50% of the tariffs, 40% of the volume of import/export trade, 69% of 
publications, 65% of China’s patent rights. 80% of new products come from medium 
and small enterprises, and 95% of them are from the non public ownership sector. 
In terms of employment, over 90% of jobs are provided by the non state sector.<a name="_ednref5" title href="#_edn5"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[5]</span></span></a></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: 17.95pt; line-height: 11.0pt">
<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 10.5pt">With increasing grievances, social 
conflicts and struggles are more frequent. In 2007 alone, there were 100,000 
instances of social confrontations, averaging 274 instances everyday. According 
to the All China Trade Union, labour disputes in 2007 amounted to 406,000 cases. 
Zhang Mingqi, the Deputy President of the All China Trade Union, remarked that 
labour disputes have increased by over 20% every year in the last few years.<a name="_ednref6" title href="#_edn6"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[6]</span></span></a></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: 17.95pt; line-height: 11.0pt">
<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 10.5pt">However much the party-state 
leaders pledge to tackle the aggravating social and economic problems, they will 
not implement any radical democratic reform. The majority of the people in China 
will continue to come under the tyranny of both the political system and the 
market. Any real change going from the bureaucratic political totalitarianism to 
socialist democracy will have to depend on the rise to struggle by the broad 
masses.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4 April 2008</span></p>
