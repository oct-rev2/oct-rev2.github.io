<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 11.0pt">The Chinese Communist Party had 
conducted a ruthless persecution of dissidents in its several decades of rule. 
Under pressure, in 1978, some verdicts were rehabilitated. However partial and 
selective the official rehabilitation was, historians have since responded with 
a probe into historical cases of wronged doings. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: 24.0pt; line-height: 14.0pt">
<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 11.0pt">In No. 2, 2005 of the journal <i>
Bainianchao</i> (<i>Tide of a Century</i>), a scholar Zeng Xianxin wrote an 
article entitled “The Chinese Trotskyists were not traitors”. The article 
asserts that “after investigation and research by various sectors, many history 
researchers are negative about this issue [that the Chinese Trotskyists were 
traitors].”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 14.0pt">
<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 11.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In No.7, 2006 of the 
journal <i>Yanhuang Chunqiu</i> (<i>Annals of the Chinese People</i>), Ma 
Changhong wrote an article entitled “Changes in the Chinese Communist Party’s 
evaluation of Trotsky”. He points out that “For almost 80 years, among several 
generations, the word Trotsky or ‘Trotskyists’ was synonym with the words 
reactionary or counter-revolutionary. As early as October 1929, in ‘The Party 
Central’s Resolution on fighting opportunism and the Trotskyist opposition 
inside the party’, the allegation was that the Trotskyist opposition ‘has 
actively attacked and sabotaged the Party politically, organizationally, and in 
various aspects.’ The phrase ‘traitor Trotskyists’ even appeared in Mao Zedong’s 
famous essay ‘On Protracted Warfare’.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 14.0pt">
<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 11.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The changes in the CCP’s 
evaluation of Trotsky have subtly changed. In the 1952 edition of <i>Selected 
Works of Mao Zedong</i>, a footnote on Trotsky went like this: “The Trotsky 
clique was originally a faction against Lenin in the Russian workers movement. 
Later it degenerated into a totally counter-revolutionary bandit gang, The 
current Trotskyists are not a political faction within the proletariat, but a 
gang of assassins, saboteurs, spies, agents and murderers without principles or 
thoughts; they are a gang of deadly enemy to the proletariat, employed and used 
by foreign intelligence organs.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 14.0pt">
<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 11.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the 1991 edition of the 
same book, the footnote on Trotsky changed to the following: “Trotsky 
(1879-1940) had served as Chairman of the Revolutionary Military Commission 
after the victory of the October Revolution. In November 1927, he was liquidated 
from the Party. In the international communist movement, Trotsky had conducted 
many splitting and sabotage activities.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 14.0pt">
<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 11.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the above rendition, 
although the general evaluation of Trotsky is negative, the two major changes 
are that Trotsky’s role after the October Revolution was added, and large 
amounts of slanders were deleted.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 14.0pt">
<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 11.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the 1993 edition of 
Volume one of <i>Writings of Mao Zedong</i>, the footnote on Trotsky was further 
revised: “Trotsky (1879-1940) had served as Central Politburo member of the 
Russian Social Democratic Workers Party (the Bolsheviks), and Chairman of the 
Revolutionary Military Commission, etc. After Lenin died, he opposed Lenin’s 
theories and lines on the building of socialism in the Soviet Union, and 
organized an opposition within the Soviet party (Bolsheviks), and conducted 
factional activities. In November 1927, he was expelled from the Party.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 14.0pt">
<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 11.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this rendition are three 
changes: confirming Trotsky’s leadership role in the Bolshevik Party; replacing 
the more derogatory word “liquidated” with the more neutral word “expelled”; and 
removing the allegation that Trotsky conducted splitting and sabotage activities 
in the international communist movement.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 14.0pt">
<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 11.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Furthermore, in 2002, in 
volume one of the new edition of <i>History of the Chinese Communist Party</i> 
published by the official Chinese Communist Party Press, it is written that: 
“Some of Trotsky’s understanding of the class nature of the two cliques of 
Chiang Kai Shek and Wang Ching Wei after the Great Revolution period, his 
judgement that they will be betraying the revolution, and his criticisms on the 
mistakes of Stalin in guiding the Chinese revolution were correct or basically 
correct;” “Trotsky thought that Stalin should be responsible for the defeat of 
the Great Chinese Revolution.” However, the footnote retained the comment that 
“After Lenin died, he opposed Lenin’s theories and lines on the building of 
socialism in the Soviet Union.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 14.0pt">
<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 11.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The most important change 
in evaluation can be found in the 1999 edition of volume 6 of <i>Writings of Mao 
Zedong</i>: ““Trotsky (1879-1940) had served as Central Politburo member of the 
Russian Social Democratic Workers Party (the Bolsheviks), and the President of 
the Petrograd Soviet during the October Revolution. After the October 
Revolution, he had served as People’s Commissar for Foreign Relations, People’s 
Commissar for the Army and Marines, Chairman of the Revolutionary Military 
Commission, and member of the Comintern Executive Committee, etc. In October 
1926, at the plenary session of the Soviet Party (Bolsheviks) Central Committee, 
his role as member of the Central Politburo was removed. In January 1927, the 
Comintern Executive Committee resolved to remove his role as Executive Committee 
member. In November of the same year, he was expelled from the Party. In January 
1929, he was exiled from the Soviet Union. In August 1940, he was assassinated 
in Mexico.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 14.0pt">
<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 11.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This rendition removed 
allegations that Trotsky “opposed Lenin’s theories and lines on the building of 
socialism in the Soviet Union,” and that he “organized an opposition within the 
Soviet party (Bolsheviks), and conducted factional activities,” allegations 
which were there in the original footnote. It listed all the important roles 
Trotsky had played during and after the October Revolution. It also used the 
word “assassinated” rather than words like “executed”.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 14.0pt">
<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 11.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It must however be noted 
that such changes, while reflecting a more objective and just evaluation of 
Trotsky’s life and activities, have not taken place in official CCP documents, 
hence the official rehabilitation is yet to come.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 14.0pt">
<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 11.0pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 14.0pt">
<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 11.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, there has 
been a wave of positive re-evaluation of Chen Duxiu, one of the founders of the 
Chinese Communist Party and the Trotskyist group in China, both in the academia, 
and in the general public. In the January 2008 issue of a CCP organ <i>Shanghai 
Party History and Party Building</i>, an article by Shi Zhongquan, former deputy 
director of the CCP Central’s Institute on Party History, which was an academic 
report made by Shi in an academic symposium in December 2007 in Wuhan on the CCP 
history, wrote that it is not correct to put all responsibility of the Party’s 
mistakes in the last stage of the Great Revolution on Chen Duxiu himself. The 
main sources of his mistakes were from the Comintern and from the Party itself. 
Chen Duxiu’s contributions in his whole life were more than his demerits. Shi 
went on to list Chen’s contributions, including his pioneer work in promoting 
the New Cultural Movement at the beginning of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, his 
founding of the Chinese Communist Party, his leadership in the CCP for the first 
five Central Committees, enabling the CCP to grow from a 50-person membership to 
almost 60,000. Shi says that Chen had contributed much to the Marxist analysis 
of the Chinese revolution, and had been in the prison of the warlords and of the 
nationalist Party, and he had all his life waged a heroic struggle against the 
reactionary forces. Shi held that of the two main mistakes that Chen committed, 
the first one, that he took a rightist line in the last stage of the Great 
Revolution, it was a question of different lines within the Party and was not a 
question of being revolutionary or counter-revolutionary. As for the second 
mistake, that he was involved in the Trotskyist defeatist faction, that had to 
do with the intra-party struggle in the Soviet party; Chen had not jeopardized 
the Chinese people or the Chinese nation, and had not engaged in any espionage 
work. Shi concluded that Chen’s played 70% positive role and 30% negative role.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 14.0pt">
<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 11.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shi’s last remarks were 
that it was time for an overall evaluation of Chen Duxiu’s contributions. 2009 
would be Chen Duxiu’s 130<sup>th</sup> anniversary, and party historians should 
prepare for the rehabilitation of Chen Duxiu, restoring his party membership, 
and convening academic seminars.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 14.0pt">
<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 11.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The CCP had for long 
slandered Trotskyists as traitors and jackals of imperialism. On 22 December 
1952, the CCP arrested all Trotskyists throughout China. Some of them were 
deprived of their freedom for two or three decades on charges of 
“counter-revolutionary”. Such wronged cases are still to be rehabilitated. &nbsp;</span></p>
