<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin: 0">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">On the New Year Day of </span>
<span lang="EN-HK" style="font-size: 12.0pt">2020, more than one million Hong 
Kong people defied violent threats from the authorities and demonstrated in the 
streets, continuing the mass mobilizations started from last June. The slogans 
of the resistance have changed from “Hongkongers Add Oil” to “Hongkongers 
Fight”, from breaking old chains to constructing a new society.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin: 0">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">Hong Kong police has violently 
repressed the protests, particularly the brutal invasions in the campus of 
Chinese University of Hong Kong (CU) and Hong Kong Polytechnic University (Poly 
U) in last November. On the day of confronting CU protesters, the police fired 
4,693 <em><span style="color: black; background: white">ammunitions, including
</span></em><i>2,330 </i>tear gas; on the second day of surrounding Poly U, the 
police fired 7,647 ammunitions, including 3,293 tear gas. From June to November 
2019, the police fired a total of 29,863 ammunitions. Up to 15 January 2020, the 
police arrested 7,019 protesters, of which 40% were students.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin: 0">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">Hong Kong protesters, particularly 
the youths, were very brave in confronting police brutality. Their resistance 
drew a lot of attention in the international media. According to a survey in the 
United States, over half of the interviewees sympathized with the protesters. 
That pressured the US Congress and President Trump to pass the
<span style="color: black; background: white">Hong Kong Human Rights and 
Democracy Act. Hong Kong Government and the regime in Beijing then tried more 
covert repressive measures.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin: 0">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt; color: black; background: white">
Beijing suddenly replaced the Director of the Liaison Office of the Central 
Government in Hong Kong, showing their dissatisfaction with him. Yet under the 
theme of reinforcing overall rule, the policy of repression against the 
resistance remains unchanged. Even though Beijing intends to improve Hong Kong’s 
economy and people’s livelihood, it will not be effective due to vested 
interests. Moreover, the goals of the resistance are not about economic issues, 
but the political demands of withdrawal of extradition bill, and then of 
resisting the brutality of the government and the police. The driving force of 
sustained resistance is humanistic sympathy and support towards the protesters 
on the frontline.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin: 0">
<span lang="EN-HK" style="font-size: 12.0pt">The mass resistance against 
repression has resulted in the breaking of old chains:</span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt"> 
breaking through political indifference and dependency, refusing the existing 
order, resisting the regime and the elite rule of vested interests.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin: 0">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">On the other hand, the violent 
repression reveals the huge disparity in force between the police and the 
protesters.&nbsp; More protesters understand the heavy cost of armed struggle, and 
worse still, that it will not solve the problem. Thus, it becomes necessary to 
explore alternatives.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin: 0">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">The turning point of the 
resistance, from marching on the streets to building people’s power in the 
society, is marked by the overwhelming victory of the pan-Democratic parties and 
the failure of pro-Beijing parties in the District Council Elections on 24 
November 2019, opening the way for organization in the society based on social 
and livelihood demands.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin: 0">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">Meanwhile, a yellow economic 
circle, or ethical consumer circle, with the aim of reinforcing solidarity, has 
been in experiment soon after the resistance began. In recent months, there were 
long queues along the so-called yellow shops. In addition, online yellow shops 
and collective purchasing are in practice. Some people withdrew money from banks 
which belongs to mainland capital or exchanged Hong Kong dollars with US 
dollars. The possibility of community currency is also put on the agenda. All 
that means people are using the identity of consumer to fight.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin: 0">
<span lang="EN-HK" style="font-size: 12.0pt">Traditionally, working class 
organize trade unions to fight against capitalists. On 5 August 2019, several 
hundred thousand students, workers, and merchants went on strike against the 
regime. The march on New Year Day was for the first time led by trade unions, 
symbolising efforts on building </span>
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">people’s power via </span>
<span lang="EN-HK" style="font-size: 12.0pt">trade unions. Old and new trade 
unions work together to link political demands with workers’ movements. At the 
end of 2019, the “Two Million Citizens’ Joint Alliance for Strikes” has 49 trade 
unions, with 18 new or being formed, and the total number of members in the new 
trade unions exceeded 6000. By the end of January 2020, the number of applicants 
for Hospital Authority Employee Alliance alone has exceeded 15,000.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin: 0">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">So far, Hongkongers have forged an 
identity of unity to fight the regime and are in the long and fluctuating 
process of trying to organize autonomous forces at the grassroots level, explore 
pluralism and democratic self-governance, and resist efforts by the regime and 
elites to divide the movement with propaganda for Hong Kong Independence or 
emphasis on the State. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin: 0">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">It takes long and hard work to 
construct a new society that is based on conscience and fraternity instead of 
cut-throat competition, that respects life over profits, shows social justice 
with rule of law for the interests of the people, and achieves equality, 
overcoming discriminations based on gender, age, race, religion, culture, 
education, and others. Due to the lack of a clear vision and path, the 
resistance has to learn lessons from the experiences of resistances world-wide, 
in order to fight for a better future.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin: 0">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">The Arab Spring of 2011 inspired a 
new wave of global resistances. In 2019, there were widespread resistances and 
struggles. While crises of capitalism deepen, more and more people, particularly 
the young, are rising up to fight against corrupt regimes, economic crises, 
global warming, among others. The Rojava experience is especially worth 
studying. Since the outbreak of civil war in Syria in 2011, Rojava has strived 
to be an autonomous movement. It forges alliance among Kurds, Arabs, and other 
peoples. While organizing “People’s Defense Force” and “Women’s Defense Force” 
against invasion, Rojava emphasizes the importance of local autonomy, women’s 
liberation, and ethnical co-existence and harmony, as well as implementing 
different democratic institutions based on cooperatives. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin: 0">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">Looking back at recent years of 
resistance in Hong Kong, we find that the Umbrella Movement of 2014 was 
suppressed but it </span><span lang="EN-HK" style="font-size: 12.0pt">triggered 
the valiant resistance in the Fish-ball Revolt in 2016. Since 2019, there are 
large-scale mass movements against the regime, with the unity of the valiants 
and non-violent protestors. After experiencing the limits of </span>
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">resisting the brutal regime on the 
streets<span style="color: black; background: white">, the movement has begun 
exploring alternative ways of </span>building more deep-rooted and long-lasting 
people’s power in the society, from breaking old chains to constructing a new 
society. While having ups and downs, it is evolving as an important experiment 
of grassroots people’s struggles for autonomy.</span></p>
