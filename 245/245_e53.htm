was launched in 1974, </span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">and </span>
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt">has continuously existed for 45 years. Comrade 
Zhang Kai, one of the founders and the editor-in-chief, had tirelessly and 
single-mindedly worked for 45 years in editing, writing, proofreading, and 
publication, until he passed away on 4 September 2018. He had raised the flag of 
Communism all his life even at the fragile age of 99, with very limited 
resources in hand. One year before, he wrote down his will that <i>October 
Review</i> will continue. The Editorial Board pledges to carry on his legacy.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 21.0pt; line-height: 200%; layout-grid-mode: char">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt">One year after the outbreak of the May-Fourth 
Movement of 1919, </span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 12.0pt">C</span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">omrade 
Zhang Kai was born into a peasant family in Zhongshan, Guangdong Province, 
China. He was talented, loved reading, and was the only child in the family who 
could enter high school. The late 1920s and early 1930s in the Republican era 
was a time of upheaval. Young people generally opposed imperialist invasion and 
searched for socialist alternatives. The primary school in which Zhang Kai 
studied organized demonstrations against Japanese imperialist invasion. At that 
time, Zhang Kai was only a primary school student. He waved a small paper flag 
in the demonstration and shouted the slogan “Down with the imperialist powers! 
Down with the warlords!”. The middle school which Zhang Kai studied recruited 
many progressive young intellectuals as staff. The principal graduated from 
Jinan University in Guangzhou. Huang Jingbo, a teacher who graduated from Peking 
University, became a Trotskyist and then came back to his home town. Zhang Kai 
was greatly influenced by his teachers. He initiated discussions and debates 
about current affairs, coordinated writings for the noticeboard, joined 
Zhongshan Youth Wartime Services Group, organized activities against Japanese 
invasion, and served the wounded under Japanese bombing.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 21.0pt; line-height: 200%; layout-grid-mode: char">
<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 12.0pt">It was an era when personal 
interests were not taken into account. Passionate young people were everywhere. 
At the age of 16, Zhang Kai passed an examination with an excellent result to 
enter Guangdong No.1 High School, the most famous high school in Guangdong 
province. The following year, Zhongshan fell into Japanese hands. The school 
moved to Macau. Despite the hardship in wartime, Zhang Kai could have continued 
to pursue his studies like his peers. At that time, Communist Alliance of China, 
a Trotskyist organization, desperately needed somebody to take up publication 
work and approached him. Zhang Kai immediately quit his studies and took over 
the task, and moved to Hong Kong. Days and nights, he worked hard alone in a 
small room in Mongkok, Kowloon. He did the typesetting layout to print pamphlets 
calling for fighting against Japanese invasion, as well as periodicals and 
internal documents. Meanwhile, he took a course at a leftist news institute at 
Caine Road, Central, Hong Kong Island. He practiced self-learning as much as he 
could. At the age of 20, he formally joined Communist Alliance of China.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 21.0pt; line-height: 200%; layout-grid-mode: char">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt">In the next eighty years, Zhang Kai remained 
committed and dedicated to the cause. Same as his Trotskyist comrades, his path 
was thorny and challenging. Yet, compared with the majority of Trotskyist 
comrades, Zhang Kai was fortunate as he was not destroyed by persecutions, 
slanders, suppressions, or killings conducted by the powerful blocs including 
Japanese imperialists, Kuomintang, Communist Party of China (CPC), or British 
imperialists. After all, Zhang Kai had lived almost one century in which he 
truly demonstrated how a communist, powerless and suffering from tremendous 
political oppressions, held on to his faith and led a life of dignity and 
selflessness. He endured without complaint or regret in all these times of 
turmoil.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 21.0pt; line-height: 200%; layout-grid-mode: char">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt">Zhang Kai personally experienced immense 
physical and mental pain. When he was 22 years old, a workers’ strike happened 
in a silk factory in Shanghai. Three women comrades were arrested, one of whom 
was an intellectual who could not stand torture and disclosed names and 
addresses of comrades. Zhang Kai was implicated and was also arrested. The 
Japanese military police and Chinese secret police tortured </span>
<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 12.0pt">Zhang Kai with electric shock, 
waterboarding, beatings, among others. However, Zhang Kai refused to betray 
comrades. He was released after three months of detention.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 21.0pt; line-height: 200%; layout-grid-mode: char">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt">At the age of 30, he was arrested for a second 
time. This time it was in Hong Kong. He was charged by the British Hong Kong 
authorities for publishing pamphlets of political propaganda, and for organizing 
illegal political activities. He was tortured by British police inspectors and 
Chinese police from the Political Bureau. Again, he refused to give in. One 
month later, he was deported for life from Hong Kong to Guangzhou. In 1951, he 
secretly went back to Hong Kong, and escaped the nation-wide arrest by CPC on 
Winter Solstice Day of 1952, the day after Stalin’s 74th birthday. More than one 
thousand Trotskyist comrades and sympathizers either died in prison or lost 
their freedom for up to one-third of a century.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 21.0pt; line-height: 200%; layout-grid-mode: char">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt">Although Zhang Kai was supposed to have freedom 
of the person in Hong Kong, he and his family were always under unspeakable 
mental stress. As illegal resident, there were not only inconveniences in work 
and life; there </span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 12.0pt">was always a 
risk of being arrested and deported to mainland China which meant being sent to 
prison as a Trotskyist. The threat was like a sword hanging over the head. Only 
at the age of 75 in 1995 did he get his identity card, and started a more stable 
life. Yet, with old age came all kinds of illnesses.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 21.0pt; line-height: 200%; layout-grid-mode: char">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt">When Zhang Kai was a teenager, he committed 
himself to the communist cause. Every day since then, he had worked very hard, 
never with regret about his choice. Since he joined </span>
<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 12.0pt">Communist Alliance of China at the 
age of 20, he had continuously worked on research, writing, and publication. In 
1948, Communist Alliance of China held the third National Assembly and changed 
its name to Revolutionary Communist Party of China, and Zhang Kai was elected 
secretary of the National Assembly and then secretary of the Central Committee. 
In the 1950s, after the nation-wide arrest, Trotskyist comrades in Hong Kong 
organized an interim national committee of Revolutionary Communist Party of 
China. Zhang Kai was appointed secretary until 1978 when comrade Li Xi took 
over. During that period, Zhang Kai wrote a lot of articles and also edited 
Trotskyist works. In all, he had edited 244 issues of <i>October Review</i> and 
11 volumes in a series of Studies on Socialism. He also helped with publication 
of Chen Bilan’s </span><i><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">Early Chinese 
Communist Party and the Trotskyist Revolutionary Life - My Memories</span></i><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">,
<i>Memories of Peng Shuzhi</i>, and 4 volumes of <i>Collected Writings of Peng 
Shuzhi</i>, among others. Two months before he passed away, he finished his 
autobiographical essay which not only reflected on his important experiences, 
but also gave an account of what he knew about history, debates, and 
propositions of Trotskyists in China.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 21.0pt; line-height: 200%; layout-grid-mode: char">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt">Zhang Kai was a modest person. He worked 
laboriously and quietly, not for fame, not for profit, but to advance the 
communist cause.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 21.0pt; line-height: 200%; layout-grid-mode: char">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt">Zhang Kai’s original name was Liu Gui’an. His 
pen names included Liu Mang, Kang Jun, Liu Naiguang, Wei Kang, Liu Guang, Xiang 
Sheng, Fang Xing, Ru Ri, Jun Xing, Zhen Yan, Wei Bo, Juan Di, among others. In 
the 20<sup>th</sup> century, the crises of imperialism and capitalism spurred 
the outbreak of revolutions in Russia and China. Despite the betrayals of these 
two revolutions, Zhang Kai deeply believed in the only alternative for humanity: 
to overthrow capitalism and to build communism with democracy and equality, “f<span style="color: black; background: white">rom 
each according to his ability, to each according to his need”. Moreover, he 
deeply believed that from the 1920s to the present, Chinese Trotskyists, despite 
the slanders, persecutions, and murders by the powerful, had lived for a noble 
cause. The numerous comrades, including Chen Duxiu, Peng Shuzhi, Chen Bilan, 
Zheng Chaolin, Wang Fanxi, Yin Kuan, Liu Jialiang, Ji Yunlong, Wang Zhenhua, Li 
Jieshuang, Li Yongjue, Luo Liping, Jiang Junyang, Liu Pingmei, Zhou Rensheng, 
Gao Qinyu, Lou Guohua, Zhao Li, Zheng Zekeng, Xie Shan, Xu Kekang, Wang Guolong, 
Li Xi, Zhang Hua, Chen Wen, Wu Zhongxian, and hundreds gone down in history with 
or without a name, had sacrificed themselves for the cause of communism. They 
were persons of honesty and integrity, they were honorable souls as communist 
militants.</span></span></p>
