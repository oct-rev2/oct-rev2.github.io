<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: 24.0pt">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 11.0pt">Recently, Hu Jintao, holding the 
top position of the party, military and state leadership, declared that the 
building of a socialist society of harmony is one of the primary tasks of the 
Chinese Communist Party in initiating the socialist cause with Chinese 
characteristics. He said, the society should be one where there is democracy, 
justice, honesty, friendship, dynamism, order, tranquility, and harmony with 
nature.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: 24.0pt">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 11.0pt">Wen Jiabao, the Premier, also 
stressed that building a socialist society of harmony is a key mission in the 
Government’s Work Report.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: 24.0pt">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 11.0pt">These statements come at a time 
when </span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 11.0pt">China has experienced 
over two decades of capitalist market economy. The State Council, on February 
24, issued a document “On encouraging and supporting individually or privately 
run businesses in the non-public sector”. The <i>People’s Daily</i> reported 
that privately run enterprises now constitute about 40% of the nation’s 
industrial added value and income from sales, and over 60% of the nation’s 
commodity sales and retail sales. Together with foreign capital, the non-public 
sector now constitutes over half of China’s GDP, and the majority of jobs for 
urban and non-agricultural sectors.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: 24.0pt">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 11.0pt">These figures unequivocally tell us 
that in </span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 11.0pt">China, the 
capitalist market economic forces are predominant. The Government’s Work Report 
declared that China would “implement its promises in its accession to the WTO, 
continue to lower customs tariffs, enlarge opened areas… and fully let go the 
right over foreign trade.” The pillars supporting a non-capitalist state have 
been eroded.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: 24.0pt">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 11.0pt">Wen Jiabao’s Report acceded to 
underlying problems and contradictions: the agricultural base is weak, peasants’ 
increase in income is difficult, strain of energy is acute, and pressure for 
inflation is high. At the same time, social tensions have aggravated, and the 
situation in the rural is particularly serious. The pressures from unemployment, 
irrational economic structure, and low level of skills are all bothering the 
government and society. Corruption, bureaucratism, inefficiency, extravagance 
are listed.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: 24.0pt">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 11.0pt">If the Government Report is vague 
about these problems, social surveys give the details. The Social Sciences 
Academy’s “Analyses and Projections of the Social Situation” 2004-2005 listed 
the following seven problems: 1. About 40 million peasants are landless; 2. 
Income discrepancy is such that in a survey of 50,000 urban households in the 
first half of 2004, the 10% highest income group had a dispensable income of RMB 
13,322 yuan, whereas the lowest 10% income group had only 1,397 yuan to dispense 
with; 3. Every year, 24 million people enter the labour market, but new jobs are 
only 9 million a year; 4. Poverty alleviation remains a daunting task, and the 
level of absolute poverty in the countryside is per capita annual income of 625 
yuan, which is lower than the United Nations level of about 900 yuan; 5. 
Anti-corruption can rely only on political systemic reform, yet the forces 
against corruption are too weak in China; 6. Sustainable development is 
seriously constrained by resources, energy and environment; 7. Despite the rapid 
economic growth in the last two years, the degree of contentment with life among 
the low income groups is going down.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: 24.0pt">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 11.0pt">After </span>
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 11.0pt">China’s accession to the WTO, due 
to the influx of cheap agricultural products, peasants’ livelihood has gone for 
the worse. According to the latest World Bank Report, in these three years, 
average income of peasant households has gone down by almost 1%, and that of 
some peasant households in stark poverty has gone down by 6%. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: 24.0pt">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 11.0pt">The government has acknowledged the 
severity of the rural problems, and has promulgated a series of measures to 
alleviate the situation. For example, tariffs on agricultural products are 
lifted, and the state’s investment into agriculture this year is 70 billion yuan.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: 24.0pt">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 11.0pt">However, with the rampant 
corruption and graft, often, the state’s poverty alleviation relief funds do not 
reach the beneficiaries. A newspaper report said that in a village in </span>
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 11.0pt">Jilin Province, each peasant 
household was supposed to receive 5,000 yuan from the state’s 100,000 yuan 
relief funds, yet due to corruption, each peasant household got only 50 yuan.</span><i><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 10.0pt"> 
(Apple Daily</span></i><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 10.0pt">, 23 March 
2005, quoting <i>East Asia Economic and Trade News</i>.) </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: 24.0pt">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 11.0pt">The large number of officials and 
cadres is a heavy burden on the ordinary folk. Cadres at the level of the county 
or below number 13.16 million, which means 26 ordinary people support one cadre. 
The total number of government-paid cadres is 45.72 million, and expenses over 
travel, reception and overseas training and visits used up, respectively, 300 
billion, 200 billion and 250 billion yuan.</span><i><span lang="EN-US"> </span>

</span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 10.0pt">7 March 2005)</span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 11.0pt"> 
It is also estimated that the debt of all village and township governments in 
China totaled 1 trillion yuan. The figures of the Agricultural Ministry show 
that up to the end of 2004, rural population was about 930 million, and rural 
debt was equivalent to 1,075 yuan for each peasant, which was about 40% of their 
annual income.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: 24.0pt">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 11.0pt">With rising social discontent, the 
government has gone for further political repression. Government control over 
the internet has stepped up, but this can hardly suppress the people’s voices 
demanding justice and political reform. </span></p>
