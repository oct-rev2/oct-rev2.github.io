<span style="font-size: 12.0pt">Since June 2019, Hong Kong has seen 
demonstrations of “No China Extradition Bill”, fighting for democratic justice, 
opposing violence of government, police, and triad. It has caught global 
attention. We fully support the movement of Hong Kong people’s fighting for 
democratic justice. We oppose the repressive political regime, and we need to 
deepen mass mobilization, and to link democratic justice to the economy and 
people’s livelihood, in order to build a society with equality, justice, 
bottom-up democracy, and self-governance.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 24.25pt; line-height: 200%; layout-grid-mode: char">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; background: white">There is an old Chinese 
saying that “it takes more than one cold day for a river to freeze three feet 
deep.” The Chinese central government and the Hong Kong government have always 
suppressed the democratic development in Hong Kong. Since 2003, both governments 
have planned to pass the No.23 Article of national security by any means; in 
2004, China’s </span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">National People’s Congress 
vetoed </span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 12.0pt">both the universal 
suffrages for electing Hong Kong Chief Executive in 2007 and the Legislative 
Council in 2008; in 2007, the proposal of the two universal suffrage elections 
in 2012 was rejected; in 2012, the secondary school curriculum of </span>
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt">Moral, Civic and National Education was to be 
enforced; in </span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">2014, the Resolution of 
China National People’s Congress on 31 August vetoed again the dual universal 
suffrages, which led to the Occupy Central Movement and then the Umbrella 
Movement which urged to “Let the People Get Self-rule and Universal Suffrage”; 
in 2016, some protestors in Mongkok clashes were charged for rioting</span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 12.0pt">. 
One of them was sent to prison for 7 years. It was the longest prison sentence 
for rioting since the cessation of Hong Kong to the west. In the same year, six 
legislative council members from pan-democracy group were disqualified. From 
2015 to 2018, the student leaders of Umbrella Movement, i.e., Joshua Wong, Alex 
Chow, and Nathan Law were charged with unlawful assembly and inciting other 
people to join an unlawful assembly, and they repeatedly appealed; in 2019, the 
planners of the Occupy Central Movement, i.e., Benny Tai, Chan Kin Man, and Chu 
Yiu Ming, and six other organizers were charged and sentenced to prison for 
eight to sixteen months. The social wound is getting deeper. Years of repressed 
anger will not be held down any more. The future has become uncertain.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 24.25pt; line-height: 200%; layout-grid-mode: char">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt">Hong Kong people continuously went for street 
demonstrations to make political appeals. Unfortunately, the Hong Kong 
government has been totally indifferent and refused to follow popular will. It 
made the people boil with rage. Protests have erupted unstoppably everywhere. On 
9 June, the Civil Human Rights Front held the demonstration of “Defending Hong 
Kong and Opposing China Extradition Bill”, and claimed that there were one 
million protestors plus one (the victim’s death due to protesting the bill). 
Yet, the Hong Kong government intentionally refused to listen to people’s 
voices, and declared to resume the second reading of the Bill on 12 June and 
even to advance the third reading. </span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">On 12 
June, there was a general strike, and many protestors blocked the building of 
the Legislative Council, in order to prevent the second reading of the Bill. At 
last, the police suppressed the demonstration. On 15 June, although the Hong 
Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam declared to “suspend” the Bill, but she refused 
to “withdraw” the Bill. On 16 June, </span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">the 
Civil Human Rights Front held a demonstration to urge the Hong Kong government 
to fulfil five demands: (1) A</span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;</span><a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="https://www.hongkongfp.com/2019/07/09/hong-kongs-carrie-lam-declares-extradition-bill-dead-stops-short-full-withdrawal/"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">complete 
withdrawal of the extradition bill</span></a><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">; 
(2) not charging protesters and the&nbsp;</span><a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="https://www.hongkongfp.com/2019/07/12/police-unconditionally-release-hong-kong-protester-old-ng-shot-rubber-bullet-june-12-protest/"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">unconditional 
release of all arrested protesters</span></a><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">; 
(3) Establishment of an independent inquiry about abuses of violence by the 
police; (4) Retraction of the characterization of the protest on 12 June 2019 as 
“riots”; (5) Implementation of Universal Suffrage. The organizer claimed there 
were 2 million protesters. </span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">The Hong Kong 
government was not moved by two demonstrations with millions of protestors, and 
still refused to withdraw the Bill. On 1 July, </span>
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; background: white">the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region Establishment Day, many people gathered in Admiralty and 
Wan Chai and demanded the release of the arrested protestors. At 9 pm, some 
protestors marched into the building of the Legislative Council and occupied 
there for about 3 hours. They cried out “there are no rioters, there is only&nbsp;<em>tyranny</em>”. 
Afterwards, they retreated and brought away the last four protestors who were 
unwilling to leave. On 21 July, in Yuen Long MTR Station and its vicinity, more 
than a hundred men, dressed in white, indiscriminately attacked unarmed 
passengers and passers-by. </span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">During the 
violent attacks, which lasted intermittently for nearly two hours, there was 
zero police presence. The attack <span style="background: white">completely 
created a big shock and inflicted a lasting anger among the general population. 
Afterwards, the police arrested 12 suspects but only on the charge of illegal 
assembly. On 27 July, the application for ‘Free Yuen Long’ Demonstration was 
rejected by the police, but thousands of people went to Yuen Long to denounce 
the government, police, triad, as well as rural groups of complicity in crimes 
against the people. On 28 July, demonstrations and protests continued. 
Large-scale clashes between the police and the protestors erupted. The police 
issued a lot of tear gas, rubber bullets, sponge bullets, and pepper bullets to 
dispel protestors. At last, the police arrested 49 suspects and among whom 44 
were charged with rioting.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 24.25pt; line-height: 200%; layout-grid-mode: char">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt">The majority of protestors in these 
demonstrations were young people. The government neglected public opinion, and 
worse still, it turned deaf and blind to those young people who were adamant for 
democratic justice. This led to thousands of young people going for street 
demonstrations to fight for justice, to fight against the police’s abuses of 
violence, and even the institutional violence exercised by law and police. 
Protests and resistances have happened in many communities. People are building 
Lennon Walls at every corner to voice out their ideas and discuss about 
political change. The ongoing movements are diversified. They adopt horizontal 
and participatory approaches, positing slogans such as “No Host” (to be 
self-initiated and self-organized), “Not to sever relations to your friends with 
different positions” (to show solidarity and tolerance), “be water” (to act like 
water carrying both the characteristics of tenderness and toughness), making a 
wave of protests forcing the government under pressure, interrupting the 
operation of parliamentary system, and targeting the impotent bureaucracy, the 
abusive police, the brutal triads, and the local rural bullies. In the process 
of mass movements, in the intertwining of tears and blood, there is nurtured a 
good faith of “gathering people’s power to change the world”.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 24.25pt; line-height: 200%; layout-grid-mode: char">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt">On the other hand, during the demonstrations, 
some people requested Europe and the US to intervene. They waved these flags and 
even asked for the consulates to help. It showed that they were completely 
disappointed with the Chinese government and the Hong Kong government, so they 
desperately turned to Europe and the US, even though they knew that they would 
not rescue Hong Kong. Ironically, such behaviors showed that they inherited the 
colonialist mentality. They still had illusions that Europe and the US have 
liberty, democracy, human rights, and rule of law, and are superior than the 
so-called backward countries. Thus, they begged the former colonizers for help. 
However, if we look at international political economy, we can find that Europe 
and the US, with their hegemonic financial capitalism which enables them to 
support political puppets and economic dependents, have their utmost purpose to 
maintain the financial hegemony of Europe and the US in order to control the 
world. Therefore, we believe that the large-scale democratic movement of Hong 
Kong people should develop its own strength and reject any infiltration or 
appropriation by European and US hegemony. Meanwhile, we should be vigilant 
against the Chinese government in inciting nationalism in order to shift public 
attention from covering its crimes of being complicit in the oppression by the 
Hong Kong bureaucracy on democratic development and in the super exploitation by 
big capitalists on the grassroots people.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 24.25pt; line-height: 200%; layout-grid-mode: char">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt">This democratic movement directly appeals for 
political democracy, but what the authoritative regime wants to maintain is Hong 
Kong’s inherited colonial economic system which over-exploits people and 
benefits largely transnational capitalists, particularly property-developers and 
financial groups. Therefore, an appeal for a democratic system with universal 
suffrage should be linked to a program of economic democratization which fights 
for fairness and justice and secures people’s livelihoods. That means a 
political appeal of universal suffrage, or a proposal of implementing political 
democracy, should be linked to social movements devoted to change Hong Kong’s 
capitalism with its nature of injustice and over-exploitation. Any social 
resistance at a particular time and place will succeed only if it is linked to 
global social movements against differentiation and xenophobia. Hence, Hong Kong 
social movements must be linked to grassroots and social movements of mainland 
China and the world, in order to resist together political tyranny and 
international financial monopoly capitalism, starting from bottom-up battles for 
political democracy and social justice.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 31 
July 2019</span></p>
