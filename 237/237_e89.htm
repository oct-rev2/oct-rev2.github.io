the CPC Central Committee’s Decision Concerning Some Major Questions in 
Comprehensively Moving Forward Governing the Country According to the Law”</span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">, 
stating that it must push forward the rule of law. The ultimate aim is to build 
Chinese law system which makes China a country of law. Thus it must strengthen 
the leadership of CPC. That means CPC continues to control the law and its power 
is above the law.</span></p>

<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">The Article of No.5 of China’s 
Constitution states that “All state organs, the armed forces, all political 
parties and public organizations and all enterprises and institutions must abide 
by the Constitution and the law”, meaning nationalization of the military. Now, 
the Decision reinstates that CPC absolutely dominates the military, “people’s 
army is the armed force which carries out the political task of CPC”. It implies 
that the army is under the command of CPC but not the state which obviously 
violates the Constitution.</span></p>

the School of Law of Peking University, well-known scholar of constitution and 
politics studies, remarks, “if CPC insists to dominate everything, it will be 
rule by man but not by law”, and “if there is rule by law, it should go back to 
the Report of the 13<sup>th</sup> CPC National Congress, prepared by Zhao Ziyang 
in 1987, which required the separation of the Party and the state.” (quoted from
<i>Ming Po</i>, 4 Dec 2014). What CPC has done is exactly falling behind.</span></p>

<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">A lot of evidences prove that 
officials from high ranking to district level have supreme power. It seems that 
“they are the Law”. Once the rich colludes with the powerful, they not only 
violate the law, but also exploit and oppress the people.</span></p>

during investigation. For example, Gao Zhicheng, human rights lawyer, has only a 
slice of vegetable and one bun for daily meal. Many innocent people suffer 
seriously in prison, and worse still, are sent to death. According to 
statistics, there are more than 100 innocent people wrongly sent to prison. They 
are put under house arrest even when they are released from prison.</span></p>

Dameisha Forum in Shenzhen, Hu Deping, son of Hu Yaobang (former CPC General 
Secretary), and former standing committee member of the National Committee of 
the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, pointed out, “if CPC 
does not obey the law even after seizing power, the people of the whole country 
will suffer”, and “if people’s democratic authoritarianism is not abided by law, 
the general people will suffer from some people’s authoritarianism, and worse 
still, people of the whole country will be oppressed by its own people’s 
authoritarianism” (quoted from <i>Ming Po</i>, 13 Nov 2014).</span></p>

dated 31 October 2014, the Research Institute of Rural China of Central China 
Normal University released the political volume of the report on “Development of 
Chinese Peasant Situation” in Wuhan, Hubei province. It stated that 70% of 
peasants criticized that ‘power is above the law’ and ‘money is above the law’ 
in reality. They had great doubts on legal authority and effectiveness. So some 
peasants chose to use violence once their own rights were violated. Mass 
incidents happened a lot. The report was based on the interviews of 4126 
peasants from different provinces in mainland China.</span></p>

<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">On 11 October, in Sanhui County of 
Guizhou province, thousands of people went on street demonstrations. They 
protested against the unfinished project of ‘merging townships for building one 
city’, which led to low compensation for land confiscation and a setup of an 
administration centre. The police brutally suppressed the mass demonstrations. 
At least one student was beaten to death. At last the township government 
suspended temporarily the project. On 14 October, village people of Jinning 
County, Kunming City, Yunnan province, resisted illegal land confiscation by the 
local government. They had serious conflicts with the armed police and paid 
mafia. Eight people died and 18 people were injured. The struggle has already 
lasted for two years. On 15 October, in Guangzhou city, thousands of taxi 
drivers went on strike. Their salaries have not increased for the last 20 years. 
Every year government issues unlimited licenses to make profit. On 31 October, 
in Dongxing City, Guangxi province, an anti-smuggling police unit refused to 
rescue a motor-cycle driver who was knocked down. This led to serious conflicts 
between thousands of people and the police. Nine police vehicles were destroyed. 
The incident lasted for 5 hours.</span></p>

<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">On 1 November, in New District of 
Pudong, Shanghai, 4,000 people went on demonstration. They protested against 
government policy that invited a battery factory to move in. The authorities 
were forced to announce an emergency notice of cancellation of the project. It 
was the third battery factory which was kicked away under public pressure in 
Shanghai. On 17 November, in Shaodong city, Heilongjiang province, eight 
thousand secondary and primary school teachers went on strike. They complained 
that their salaries were lower than other places and pension fund was deducted 
as well, even though the local economy was good enough. On 18 November, in 
Sanjiang Township, Haikou city, Hainan province, tens of thousands of people 
went on strike, against the building of a leprosy hospital. There were serious 
conflicts. 20 vehicles were destroyed. The situation was under control only when 
the project was suspended by the local government. On 21 November, in Nanpo 
Village, Shouyang Township, Longxi County, Dingxi City, Gansu province, over 
1000 policemen and attackers confiscated land by force. More than 20 villagers 
were injured. 4 December is China’s first Constitutional Day. Thousands of civil 
rights victims gathered in Beijing. Six policemen were wronged and committed 
suicide to protest. All these criticized CPC’s violation of the law. On 11 
December, in Jinjia Village, Shiquan Township, Guixi City, Jiangxi province, 
about 200 villagers protested against forced land confiscation of 2500 <i>mu</i>. 
They were brutally suppressed by the police. On 13 December, over 1000 workers 
of Taiwanese Liangwei Technology Company, located in Baoan County, Shenzhen, 
Guangdong province, went on strike. They protested against low salary, bad 
benefits, and deduction of overtime pay. The strike carried on. On 22 December, 
nearly 1,000 teachers of Gushi County, Henan province, went on strike. It was 
because the government’s promise of salary increase was never implemented and 
even worse, they got 18% deduction of salary. On 16 December, “Reporters Without 
Borders” released the Report 2014, stating that China is the No.1 country which 
sent the highest number of reporters and media workers to prison. Press freedom 
and reporters’ status are getting worse and worse in China. This shows that 
reporters do not enjoy freedom of rights guaranteed by the Constitution, and do 
not have any legal protection.</span></p>

<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">People’s discontents were 
aggravated. It easily triggered collective action even out of a small incident. 
The above reports of mass resistances happened recently. It is believed that 
more protests outbreaks. The existing rulers of China have continued to suppress 
social demonstrations. However, where there is oppression, there is resistance; 
there is large-scale oppression, there is large-scale resistance. It is the 
basic rule of social movement. China is no exception!</span></p>
