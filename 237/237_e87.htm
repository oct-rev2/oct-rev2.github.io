<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Occupy Movements in 
Admiralty, Causeway Bay, Mongkok, and Tsim Sha Tsui in Hong Kong, fighting for 
genuine universal suffrage, had lasted for 79 days. They were cleared by the 
Hong Kong government, under the order of the Beijing government.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The result of the 
Communication and Survey Center of Chinese University of Hong Kong showed that 
about 20% of interviewees had joined the Occupy Movement. It estimated that 
around 1.2 million Hong Kong people, or one-sixth of the whole population, had 
participated the Movement.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Movement is very unique 
in the history of Hong Kong and even China. Its main goal is innovative and 
epochal, particularly after 1997. It originated from three intellectuals 
proposing to occupy the Central to fight for genuine universal suffrage. 
Afterwards, university students and teachers from more than 10 tertiary 
institutions took the leadership. A lot of secondary school students, young 
people, and citizens echoed and supported. Once there were hundreds of thousands 
of occupants on Admiralty Square. The Movement clearly showed the occupants’ 
awakening of democracy and strong will of fighting for genuine universal 
suffrage. It was with peace, rationality, resilience, militancy, and in 
particular, with innovation when occupying the roads. The occupants were holding 
umbrellas not only to confront the tear gas of police, but also to resist the 
burning sun and heavy rains. So it was called Umbrella Movement.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">The occupants demanded a genuine 
universal suffrage in electing the Chief Executive, so they demanded the 
cancellation of the </span><span lang="EN-HK" style="font-size: 12.0pt">
August-31 Resolution by the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress 
of PRC, dictating Hong Kong’s 2017 elections for the Chief Executive, requiring 
over 50% endorsement of candidacy by the 1200-member Nominating Committee. 
However, the majority of the Nomination committee members are pro-establishment 
and conservative. It is extremely difficult for the pan-democracy parties to get 
over 50% endorsement of candidacy by the Committee. If the Committee recommends 
2 to 3 candidates, Hong Kong’s eligible voters can only choose one of them. They 
cannot nominate any preferred candidate. It is a fake and absolutely not genuine 
universal suffrage. </span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">This 
rule of game completely declines the popular demand of taking civil nomination, 
defeating the monopoly of nomination by the Committee, as well as other 
proposals such as one-eighth or one-fourth of endorsement of candidacy by the 
Committee.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">Lots of students and citizens were 
very dissatisfied with the fake universal suffrage. They joined in the Occupy 
Movement to fight for genuine universal suffrage. More and more people joined 
sit-ins. There were many reasons of discontents, for example, the inappropriate 
government policy of defending the interests of corporates and developers. This 
led to an escalating property price and housing problem. There was an enlarging 
gap between the rich and the poor. Social conflicts were aggravated. Disgruntles 
were widespread. At the beginning of the Movement, the police violently 
suppressed the Movement. They used 87 pieces of tear gas and beat the occupants’ 
heads and necks which obviously violated police internal regulations. Many 
occupants were bleeding seriously and were sent to hospital.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 24.0pt; line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">The authorities made mistakes which 
aroused people’s anger, who joined the Movement, and provided material support. 
Many individuals and organizations made declaration on the newspapers to support 
the Movement and reprimanded police violent repression. Chinese of Taiwan and 
other countries echoed and supported. Local media made series of coverage and 
reports. In mainland China, over 100 people openly declared to support the 
Movement. They were detained for a long time and many are not yet released.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 24.0pt; line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">Although the </span>
<span lang="EN-HK" style="font-size: 12.0pt">August-31 Resolution has not yet 
been cancelled and the proposal of civil nomination has not been adopted yet, 
the Movement has already shown the occupants’ courage and strong will of 
fighting for universal suffrage. The demand is getting more popular which may 
force the authorities to make some changes or reforms when they formulate the 
details of election. Nevertheless, the discontents of Hong Kong people have 
increased. The fire of resistance will not stop. There will be different kinds 
of resistances. If the future formulation of universal suffrage is not 
satisfied, there will be more serious resistances.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 24.0pt; line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">The seventy-nine-day resistance is 
just the first wave of movement. There will be continuous actions. It is 
necessary to make understandings and alliances among fighters and the ordinary 
people. It is also necessary to promote the importance of democracy at the 
grassroots level, which paves the way for the next phase of resistance.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the past two months, 
mainland people can see the scenes of Hong Kong Occupy Movement on TV and other 
media. Quite a number of them deliberately come to Hong Kong (such as Wang 
Dengyao, picket of June-fourth Democratic Movement), joined the Movement or 
observed the situation. The Movement directly challenges the authority of 
National People’s Congress and challenges the reputation of CPC. It also affects 
the future democratic movement. It enhances people’s experiences of resistance 
to the ruling class. Its influence is definitely far-reaching!&nbsp; </span></p>
