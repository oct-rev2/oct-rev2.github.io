<p class="MsoNormal" style="layout-grid-mode: char; line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 30px">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the closing ceremony of 
NPC, Xi delivered a speech on how to work hard to achieve Chinese Dream. He 
declared that Chinese Dream is </span>
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">“</span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">t</span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">o 
achieve a comprehensively well-off society, to build a prosperous, strong, 
democratic, civilized, and harmonious modern socialist country and to attain the 
great re</span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">generation </span>
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">of the Chinese nation”</span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">. 
However, in fact, for over 30 years, the path of socialism with Chinese 
characteristics is indeed the path of capitalist market economy, which is 
against socialism proposed by Marxism. Although China has become the second 
largest economic entity, its enormous wealth is highly concentrated in the hands 
of statist capitalists and private entrepreneurs. Officials are getting 
greedier; meanwhile, ordinary people are getting poorer. They suffer from 
serious inflation and social problems such as health, housing, education, and 
employment. According to <i>Wen Wei Po</i> dated 5 March, in today’s China, 
there are still 98.99 million people living under the poverty line of RMB 2,300 
per year, who absolutely cannot enjoy the fruits of economic growth.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 24.0pt; layout-grid-mode: char; line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 30px">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">This path also leads to the 
enlarging gap between the rich and the poor, the worsening social polarization, 
and the escalating tensions between officials and masses. The number of mass 
events sharply increases every year. This year the Chinese government has spent 
a huge sum of RMB 769 billion for maintaining social stability, while the budget 
of national defense is RMB 720.1 billion, after having an increase of 10%.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 24.0pt; layout-grid-mode: char; line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 30px">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">In his speech, Xi talked about the 
goals of “democracy, civilization, harmony, and people’s happiness”, but they 
were only empty words. In reality, Chinese society has become less harmonious. 
People have already been deprived of rights of democracy under the authoritarian 
bureaucracy of CPC that undoubtedly has led to a political system without 
democracy. Hence, the emerging need of Chinese people is political democratic 
reform. During the 18<sup>th</sup> CPC National Congress, there was a survey 
conducted by the Community of Strong Power of the official People’s Website. The 
result showed the top ten concern issues concerned by Netizens. The first issue 
was democratic politics; the second was anti-corruption, then social livelihood, 
economic development, among others.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 24.0pt; layout-grid-mode: char; line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 30px">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">Xi claimed that CPC and even the 
whole country would have come to the end if corruption became more serious. He 
insisted that “both tigers and flies should be defeated” and “let power remain 
in the cage of institution”. After the 18<sup>th</sup> CPC National Congress, he 
has stirred up anti-corruption campaign which captured around 30 “tigers and 
flies”, among which the highest ranking official is Li Chuncheng, the alternate 
member of the Central Committee of CPC and the general secretary of Sichuan 
Province of CPC. Xi also stated that the campaign should be against formalism, 
bureaucracy, hedonism, a</span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">nd&nbsp;extravagance&nbsp;among&nbsp;officials.</span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt"> 
However, within the CPC, government and military, there are lots of corrupted 
officials. Corruption has already become institutionalized that is an inevitable 
consequence of bureaucracy. That is why, in the past, even some high ranking 
officials declared to fight against corruption, but they failed eventually.</span></p>

<b><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">Reactions within the CPC</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 24.0pt; layout-grid-mode: char; line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 30px">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">Meanwhile, Wang Yang, member of 
Political Bureau of the Central Committee of CPC and Vice Premier, stated that 
reform metaphorically meant </span>
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 新細明體,serif">“</span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">to 
cut your own body with a knife</span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 新細明體,serif">”</span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">, 
and the next step of reform should be to dissolve the interest blocs. 
Commentators from the official media analyzed that Wang’s speech implied that 
the main obstacle of reform was the interest blocs (quoted from <i>Ming Po</i> 
dated 7 March). Will any official sacrifice and “cut his own body”? This shows 
that any fundamental reform will be resisted. Wen Jiabo, the former Premier, had 
pushed for political reform for many years. However, the conservative group 
within the high ranks of the CPC opposed him. In his last work report submitted 
to the NPC, he did not mention the political reform. This shows that the CPC 
cannot carry out political reform by itself. Xi’s speech of “Chinese Dream” 
which briefly talks about “innovative reform” and “deepening the policy of 
reform and open-door” refers to deepening Deng Xiaoping’s reform policy. His 
speech is full of beautiful promises of CPC but it does not mention how to 
concretely carry out innovative reform.&nbsp;</span></p>

<b><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">People’s Viewpoint</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="layout-grid-mode: char; line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 30px">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The survey of “People’s 
Forum”, the official website of <i>People’s Forum Magazine</i>, disclosed some 
objective opinions from the people. The survey focused on four beliefs of 
“Chinese Dream”, such as “Do you agree that CPC has enough courage and wisdom to 
accelerate reform?”, “Do you agree that to insist on and to develop socialism 
with Chinese characteristics can bring people fundamental interests?”, “Do you 
agree that only the CPC can lead people to walk the path of socialism with 
Chinese characteristics?”, and “Do you agree with the system of one ruling party 
together with participatory multi-parties?” The result showed that the 
percentage of people who disagreed was 72%-81%. This led to the deletion of the 
webpage (quoted from Li Ping’s column about China on <i>Apple Daily</i> dated 18 
April). This result unexpectedly hit Xi very hard and disclosed the illusion of 
the “Chinese Dream”.</span></p>
