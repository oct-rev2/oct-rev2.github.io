<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The growth of market 
economy in China has led to serious environmental pollutions. Here are some 
evidences.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 24.0pt; layout-grid-mode: char; line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 30px">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">According to a research conducted 
by the Institute of Environment of Renmin University of China and other 
institutions in March, air quality of nearly 90% of cities in China was bad or 
very bad. Moreover, according to a report issued by Tsinghua University and Asia 
Development Bank, the air quality in China was getting worse. If we take the air 
quality standard of World Health Organization, less than 1% of 500 big cities in 
China meet the basic standard.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 24.0pt; layout-grid-mode: char; line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 30px">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">The origins of air pollution are: 
industrial emission, vehicle emission, and coal burning. These led to a lot of 
emission of CO<sub>2 </sub>and </span>
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">Nitric oxide</span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">. 
Over the last 30 years, China’s energy demand has increased. Now it has become 
the country of the largest energy consumption in the world. The </span>

of pollutants after coal burning is higher than the international standard. It 
exceeds 14 times of European standard; meanwhile, the standard in China is not 
strict enough. Chemical industries such as just concentrate on profit-making but 
release a lot of PM2.5, which bring harm to human body.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 24.0pt; layout-grid-mode: char; line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 30px">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">Unfortunately, people who breathe 
in polluted air become sick. According to Zhong Nanshan, an expert of 
respiratory, polluted air damages heart, brain, blood vessels and nerve system. 
In Beijing, the number of lung cancer has increased by 60% for the last ten 
years. Air pollution is one of the main causes.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 24.0pt; layout-grid-mode: char; line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 30px">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">Based on the 2012 Report of 
Registered Tumor Cases, both incidence rate and mortality rate are increasing. 
Every year there are 3.12 million new cases of cancer. Every year 2.7 million 
people die of cancer (quoted from <i>Ming Po</i> dated 24 February). Now, there 
are 247 cancer villages in China. This is closely related to air pollution which 
easily induces heart diseases. For example, the Mayor of Hangzhou City suddenly 
died of heart attack when he attended the Conference in Beijing. At the time, 
Beijing was full of toxic fog. Xi Jinping asked the representatives to stay calm 
but he did not mention how the government could resolve the problem. In 
addition, the large volume of PM2.5 can bring harm to young people. Zhong 
Nanshan suggested not to organize sports activities such as 3- kilometer running 
race, and the body quality of students of primary schools and secondary schools 
has degraded. Furthermore, Yale University released a report on the index of 
environmental protection, stating that in 2012, China ranked 116 of 132 
countries in the world. It clearly showed that air pollution is very serious in 
China.&nbsp;</span></p>

<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In China, one third of 
water resources is underground water. Now, 90% of underground water is polluted, 
among which 60% is seriously polluted. Worse still, some statistics disclosed 
that 97% of underground water of cities was polluted. This phenomenon even 
spread to the countryside. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">According to 2012 Report on Marine 
Environment issued by the State Oceanic Administration of China, the risks of

More than 17 million metric tons of pollutants from the monitored rivers flowed 
into the sea. An area of 170 thousand square meters of water has not yet met the 
standard quality of seawater. In recent 5 years, there are tremendous red tide 
and soil salinization that have never happened so frequently before. In a word, 
80% of coastal ecology is terribly bad.</span><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p>

<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">Worse still, citizens get sick 
after drinking polluted water. For example, in Jinling Town of Zibo City of 
Shandong Province, surrounded by layers of factories, dwellers were forced to 
drink the polluted underground water. Many dwellers got different kinds of 
cancer. It was sadly named as “Small Town of Death”. Nearly every day a funeral 
is held. In other places of Shandong Province such as Weifang and Dongying, 
there were the outbreak of a series of pollution events which shocked the whole 
country. The polluted underground water was penetrating paddy field, then human 
and animals undoubtedly got sick after having polluted rice.</span></p>

<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover, animals and 
poultry are badly affected after drinking the polluted water. For example, in 
Xiaozhu Zhuang of Cang County of Hebei Province, nearly 800 chickens died of the 
polluted underground water.</span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
