	<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 11.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Information Office 
	of the State Council of PRC issued a white paper on Progress in China's 
	Human Rights in 2014&nbsp;on 8 June, stating that China has obtained achievements 
	in nine aspects: Right to Development, Rights of the Person, Democratic 
	Rights, Right to Impartial Trial, Rights of Ethnic Minorities, Rights of 
	Women, Children and Senior Citizens, Rights of Persons with Disabilities, 
	Right to a Clean and Healthy Environment, and Foreign Exchanges and 
	Cooperation. I would like to examine if the Paper speaks the truth.</span></p>

	<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 11.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The White Paper claims 
	that the annual income of urban and rural people has increased respectively 
	by 6.8% and 9.2%. However, it does not recognize that CPC has implemented 
	capitalist market economy which has led to the polarization between the rich 
	and the poor. According to China’s Family Development Report 2015, issued by 
	the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) of the State Council 
	on 13 May, the top 20% of the annual family income is 19 times more than the 
	lowest 20%. In addition, according to the UBS/PwC 2015 Billionaire Report, 
	issued on 26 May, in the past five years, wealth creation has shifted from 
	USA to Asia, particularly China. Now a new billionaire is born every week in 
	the first season, amounted to 224 - 300 billionaires, with total assets of 
	USD 37 trillion.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%; layout-grid-mode: char">
	<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 11.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand, 
	China has over 100 million poor people. On 5 May, NDRC announced that the 
	price of medicines was mainly decided by the market. That means people have 
	to spend more money. It was reported that over hundred patients and their 
	families demonstrated outside the office building of Chongqing Government.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%; layout-grid-mode: char">
	<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 11.0pt">In terms of Rights of the 
	Person, it states that “China strengthened supervision over foodstuffs, 
	improved laws and regulations on production safety, combated terrorism 
	according to law, attached more importance to protecting the rights of the 
	accused, detainees and criminals, and stepped up drug-control efforts to 
	protect citizens' personal rights”. However, in reality, there are lots of 
	cases of abuses of human rights. Dissidents are always detained, prosecuted, 
	and sent to prison. The recent examples are human rights lawyers such as 
	Tang Jinning, Wang Qingyin, and Yuan Xinting. Moreover, feminists such as 
	“five sisters of human rights” were arrested because of organizing 
	activities of against sexual harassment during 8 March Women Day.</span></p>

	<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 11.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Paper announces to 
	set up the Day of Constitutional Law. Ironically, Hu Jia, Beijing human 
	rights activist, spent the day under home arrest. He wrote on his blog that 
	“any citizen who carries placards stating Constitution, Democracy, and 
	Liberty, walking along the roads in Beijing city, will be arrested by the 
	police. The Party has superpower while people’s voices are suppressed.” The 
	Paper claims that the number of netizens has achieved 650 million, so the 
	internet has become a platform of getting information and expressing 
	opinions. However, on 18 June 2014, the State Administration of Press, 
	Publication, Radio, Film and Television issued the notice of not allowing 
	any news report across disciplines, or any criticism without permission from 
	the original working unit. Recently, the outspoken 21st Century Web has been 
	forced to close down. The influential 21st Century Business Herald was 
	required to restructure. </span></p>

	<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 11.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to the report 
	by Reporters Without Borders, issued on 16 December 2014, China is the 
	country having the largest number of journalists and net media workers in 
	prisons. In 2014, there were 107 journalists and civil reporters in prison, 
	amounting to 30% of the world. The Report particularly mentioned the case of 
	Gao Yu.&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand, the Central Committee of the Communist Youth 
	League of China recruited thousands of young volunteers of net civilization. 
	They are required to promote the core values of socialism and to make

	<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 11.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In terms of Right to 
	Impartial Trial, the Paper claims that “in 2014 the people's courts at all 
	levels concluded 2,708 state compensation cases, and decided on a 
	compensation amount totaling 110 million yuan. China has improved the 
	criminal victim relief system, reducing or exempting litigation fees 
	totaling 180 million yuan, so as to protect the litigation relief rights of 
	impoverished people.” However, many human rights activists and lawyers like 
	Pu Zhiqiang and dissidents like Liu Xiaobo were detained or arrested without 
	open trial.</span></p>

	<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 11.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Paper claims that 
	“China's ethnic minorities and areas inhabited by ethnic minorities made new 
	developments in various social programs”, and there are 358 living Buddha. 
	But how can this prove that ethnic minorities' civil, political, economic, 
	cultural and social rights were further guaranteed? The authentic rights of 
	ethnic minorities should be the rights of autonomy. Under the political and 
	economic oppression by the dominating Han ethnic group, ethnic minorities 
	like Tibetans and Uygur people have suffered. Their desperate and armed 
	resistances are labeled as terrorist attacks.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%; layout-grid-mode: char">
	<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 11.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Worse still, the facial 
	appearance and clothing of ethnic minorities are strictly controlled. It was 
	reported that Kashgar court charged a Uygur man of wearing a beard and his 
	wife of wearing a veil and robe. It led to serious criticisms by netizens.</span></p>

	<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 11.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Paper claims that 
	“the people’s courts at various levels concluded 1,048 criminal cases 
	involving the kidnapping of women and children and sexual assault on minors, 
	“the mother-to-child transmission rate of AIDS dropped to 6.3 percent”, 
	“home care and community services now cover 70 percent” in urban and rural 
	areas.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%; layout-grid-mode: char">
	<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 11.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, in reality, 
	there are still cases of women fighting against domestic violence, sexual 
	harassment and discrimination. Gender equality is not yet achieved. 
	Moreover, the tragedy of dead children in remote areas disclosed that the 
	marginality become the victims of national economic growth. For example, in 
	Bijie county of Guizhou province, four poor children committed suicide. Last 
	year, five left-behind children were found dead near the rubbish bin. It is 
	reported by People’s web that there are 60 million left-behind children in 
	the countryside. The rural elderly are also suffering. According to a survey 
	conducted by Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, 68.4% of rural 
	old people mainly depend on their children’s earnings, the second is 
	government subsidies and farm products, and 54.6% are still doing heavy farm 
	work. Some are even abandoned and become beggars in the city. </span></p>

	with financial difficulties and of nursing subsidies to those suffering from 
	a high degree of disability”, “blind people who sat the national college 
	entrance examinations in 2014 took the exams in braille, or with the

	taking the exams”. However, it is not enough. How about those suffering from

	clean and healthy environment, and further exploring a new way to make 
	ecological progress with Chinese characteristics”, “remarkable results in 
	energy conservation and emission reduction.&nbsp;Punishments for activities
