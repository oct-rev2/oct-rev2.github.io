<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">Under the CPC policy of suppressing 
press freedom, a lot of Chinese dissidents such as Gao Yu, a well-known 
journalist, Pu Zhiqiang, a human rights lawyer, Tang Jingling and Lu Ji, were 
arrested, detained, or sent to prison. This shows again that the CPC has 
fabricated many wrong cases.</span></p>

was said that she was forced to plead guilty, as her son, Zhao Men, was under

which had already been publicly carried out in university classrooms.</span></p>

<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Gao Yu’s profession is to 
speak out the truth. On 3 June 1989, she was arrested for her news reports on 
the students’ movement. She was released in August 1990. In 1993, she was again 
arrested and sent to prison for six years, due to the accusation of leaking 
state secrets. In February 1999, she was allowed to have compassionate release. 
Meanwhile, she continued to contribute many articles on politics, economics, and 
social changes of China to Hong Kong and overseas media. She steadfastly defends 
freedom of speech and press, defying the oppressive regime.</span></p>

to defend people’s legal rights, particularly defending dissident writers and 
journalists. He was arrested one year ago. Recently the Beijing court charged 
him of “inflicting racial hatred and causing social disturbance”, due to his 
postings on Sina Weibo. His comments o</span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">n

brutal, the attackers’ sins were grievous. If you say Xinjiang is producing 
terror, now I believe it, but this is effect, not cause. The deaths and injuries 
were utterly horrendous, the repercussions too grave. You tell me that you bear 
no responsibility for the savagery of the Xinjiang independents, then I’m not

<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pu actively joined the 
Democratic Movement of 1989 and joined the hunger strike at Tiananmen Square. He 
was arrested three days after he participated in a seminar on the 25<sup>th</sup> 
anniversary of June-Fourth Movement. This is obviously a political prosecution 
by the authorities. There is no rule of law at all in today’s China. Gao Yu 
complained that the authorities trampled on the judiciary.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="layout-grid-mode: char; line-height: 150%">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In October 2014, the CPC 
passed the decision on the rule of law by the country, however, it was still 
under the control of the Party. On 23 April, addressing Japanese experts’ 
questions on how the Chinese Constitution fulfilled the rule of law, Wang 
Qishan, the secretary of Committee for Disciplinary Inspection of CPC, clearly 
answered that it had Chinese characteristics that the system of judiciary in 
China was completely under the leadership of the Party. This proves that the 
authorities negate the rule of law, undoubtedly leading to tremendous wrong 
cases. People will fight against this injustice and urge the authorities to 
release all dissidents in jails.</span></p>
