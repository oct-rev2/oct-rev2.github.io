Norms of Political Life within the Party</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 24.0pt; layout-grid-mode: char; line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 30px">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt">The 6<sup>th</sup> Plenary Session of the 18<sup>th</sup> 
CPC Central Committee was held on 25-27 October 2016, which approved the Norms 
of Political Life within the Party under Current Situations. The Norms firstly 
state that “during a long period, the political life within the Party has some 
serious problems, particularly, some cadres including the high-ranking ones, who 
do not strongly believe in Communist ideas, pay less loyalty to the Party, and 
ignore disciplines……different ways of being obsessive with money, and there are 
obvious problems such as being indulged in formalities, bureaucracy, Hedonism, 
and luxuriousness; the bans of appointment by <span style="background: white">
favoritism, buying and selling official posts, </span>bribes in the elections 
are not </span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">at all </span>
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt">effective; phenomena like abuses of power, 
corruption, illegalness are widespread. A very handful of high-ranking officials 
have political ambitions and are obsessive with power, who attempt to seize 
power though political conspiracy such as <span style="background: white">
feigning compliance and making cliques. These problems seriously erode the moral 
values of the Party, seriously destroy the solidarity and unity of the Party, 
seriously bring harm to the political life of the Party and its reputation, 
seriously affect the development of the Party and the people. This requires us 
to strengthen continuously the construction of the Party with the spirits of 
innovation, openness, and reformation, to further regulate the political life 
within the Party, and to upgrade the standard of scientific construction of the 
Party.</span>”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="layout-grid-mode: char; line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 30px">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, the Committee states that it 
should stipulate the Norms, with 12 points, which include: (1) to strengthen 
Communist beliefs; (2) to insist on the basic principles of the Party; (3) to 
insist on defending the authority of the central government; (4) to obey the 
political regulations of the Party; (5) to keep the close relations between the 
Party and the masses; (6) to hold on to the principle of democratic 
concentration; (7) to carry out democracy within the Party and to protect the 
rights of party members; (8) to insist on the principle of right appointment; 
(9) to tighten the Party system of organization life; (10) to implement 
criticisms and self-criticisms; (11) to strengthen the constraints and 
supervision on power operation; (12) to maintain the nature of political 
integrity. Every norm has its very detailed explanation which requires every 
party member to comply with.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="layout-grid-mode: char; line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 30px">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the history of the CPC always 
proves that t<span style="background: white">he higher authorities have policies 
but the local officials have their countermeasures, and they work in a 
perfunctory manner. This kind of countermeasure has existed for a long period 
and is everywhere. Thirty years ago, the CPC started to implement the policy of 
capitalist economy, ironically named “socialism with Chinese characteristics”. 
Party members are crazy for money and run to get large amounts of private 
properties. Political power becomes strengthened once it is intertwined with 
money power. Nearly every official is corrupted. It is impossible for them to 
give up their interests.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="layout-grid-mode: char; line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 30px">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is an old saying that we should learn 
from the past. We should learn from history. The past experiences of the CPC 
prove that, in the third paragraph of the Norms, it confesses that in 1980, the 
third year of the policy of reform and open up, the Fifth Plenary Session of the 
11<sup>th</sup> CPC Central Committee concluded seriously that because of the 
lesson of the Cultural Revolution, they stipulated the Norms of the Political 
Life within the Party which was important to correct the wrongs, and to restore 
and improve the political life within the Party, to advance the construction of 
the Party. Its main principles and regulations are still effective and we should 
continue to comply with it.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="layout-grid-mode: char; line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 30px">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This showed that the same norms and 
regulations had already been announced, however, it could not avoid the 
so-called “serious problems”, as the Norms mentioned above.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 24.0pt; layout-grid-mode: char; line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 30px">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt">For example, the first norm saying “to 
strengthen communist beliefs”, and its explanation is that “the Communist great 
vision and the great common vision of Chinese Socialism are the mental pillars 
and political spirit of the CPC, and they are also the thought base of 
solidarity and unity of the CPC. It should highly emphasize the importance of 
construction of political thought. Strengthening the Communist thought should be 
the first priority of the work of political life within the Party”.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="layout-grid-mode: char; line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 30px">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp; Another example: “The Shrinking of Communist 
Thought is the most dangerous one. The fall of Communist Thought is the most 
terrible one.” However, in reality, it is precisely the Communist thought of the 
CPC has already shrunk and fallen. In 1978, Deng Xiaoping, the leader of the 
CPC, advocated the policy of reform and open up, turned planned economy into 
capitalist market economy, opened the door for foreign investment, with his 
famous wording: “let some people become rich first”, that meant it allowed the 
bourgeoisie to develop in China. Afterwards, with the economic boom, the 
non-public economy quickly developed and took many advantages, meanwhile, the 
state-run or the public one became smaller. According to <i>Nangfang Daily</i> 
(dated 11 March 2016), quoted from <i>Wen Wei Po</i> (dated 12 March 2016), a 
commentary stated that the policy of reform and open up has been carried out for 
over 30 years. The non-public ownership of economy has developed from nowhere to 
everywhere, from small scale to large scale, from weak sector to strong sector. 
Now, the non-public one already accounts for 90% or above of market subjects, 
and created over 60% of GDP, over 80% of social employment, over 65% of fixed 
asset investment, and over 67% of foreign direct investment.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 24.0pt; layout-grid-mode: char; line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 30px">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt">The above figure shows that the public ownership 
of economy that was emphasized by the CPC is longer the so-called “the main 
subject”, which only accounts for below 10% of the market subjects, and it only 
creates below 40% of GDP, below 35% of fixed asset investment, below 20% of 
social employment. All these prove that public-ownership economy is no longer 
the main essence of China’s economy. (This is quoted from my paper entitled, “</span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">Living 
Proof of Revival of Capitalism in China</span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">”, 
published in <i>October Review</i>, No.240). Its shrinking will continue. It is 
not convincing for the CPC to continue to use the name of “socialism”.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="layout-grid-mode: char; line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 30px">
<b><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">The CPC Regulations on Internal Supervision</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="layout-grid-mode: char; line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 30px">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The highest ranks of the CPC obviously know 
that only a very few leaders at different levels, officials, and party members 
can whole-heartedly implement the Norms. Moreover, there are many problems 
unsolved. Therefore, the Committee approved the CPC Regulations on Internal 
Supervision. Its first article says that “to order to maintain the leadership of 
the CPC, it should strengthen the party construction, more strident governance, 
more internal supervision, and to keep the advancement and purity of the CPC, 
according to the Charters of the CPC.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 18.0pt; layout-grid-mode: char; line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 30px">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt">The Regulations have eight chapters and 47 
article, particularly with the details of supervision missions of different 
levels of dominant institutes, leaders, party committees, cadres, members, among 
others. However, it practices only within the Party, so it rejects public 
supervision and people supervision, strictly controls newspaper and internets to 
disclose any official scandal, refuse to disclose officials’ private properties. 
This only makes officials protect each other. If it cannot strengthen inner 
supervision, there will be no achievement resulting from practicing strict 
governance.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 18.0pt; layout-grid-mode: char; line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 30px">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt">No 27 of the Regulations confesses that “the 
disciplinary institution should take the defending of political discipline and 
political regulation of the Party as the first priority. It should redress the 
misbehaviors of t<span style="background: white">he higher authorities 
announcing policies but the local officials have their countermeasures; making 
cliques; cheating and confronting the Party, among others.</span>”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="layout-grid-mode: char; line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 30px">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wang Qishan, the executive member of the 
Political Bureau of the CPC as well as the general secretary of the Disciplinary 
Committee of the CPC, points out that the weakening leadership, absence of party 
construction, no strict governance, loose regulations, and corruption have 
endangered the base and security of the Party authority. He discloses: since the 
18<sup>th</sup> CPC Central Committee, the national disciplinary institutions 
have already dealt with over 1 million cases, and meted out party and 
administrative punishment to one million party members. Lots of suppressions 
prove how serious the problem is.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="layout-grid-mode: char; line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 30px">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="layout-grid-mode: char; line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 30px">
<b><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">Xi Jinping be the “Core” of Power</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="layout-grid-mode: char; line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 30px">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before that, Xi Jinping has already been the 
highest-ranking leader of the Party, the State, the Military, and the Pubic 
Security. Now he becomes “the core of power”, showing that he wants to be the 
center of power and the most dominant figure. After taking such immense power, 
Xi can do personal cult without any hesitation. This Meeting make him further 
strengthen his powerful position, expel his enemies and get his obedient 
relatives promoted.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 24.0pt; layout-grid-mode: char; line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 30px">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt">There is a statement “to insist on collective 
leadership” in the documents, nonetheless, there is no more trace of words like 
“against individual authoritarianism” which was written in the Norms of 
Political Life within the Party 36 years ago. This proves Xi is practicing 
authoritarianism without check.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10/12/2016</span></p>
