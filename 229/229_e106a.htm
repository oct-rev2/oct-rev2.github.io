Zhao Lianhai Must be Released Now!&nbsp; Zhang Kai</span></b></p>

<span lang="EN-US">As his son was one of the victims of drinking contaminated 
milk with melamine, Lawyer Zhao Lianhai founded a blog named ‘Home for Kidney 
Stones Babies” to help those affected families to fight for compensation and 
better treatment. Unfortunately, he was also arrested and charged for “provoking 
quarrels and troubles” and then sent to prison for two and a half years.</span></p>

<span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This has aroused public indignation. Hong Kong Bar 
Association and The Law Society of Hong Kong issued a joint declaration to 
support Zhao. Twenty-seven members of the National People’s Congress (NPC) 
jointly wrote an open letter to ask for a light sentence. Meanwhile, Liu 
Mengxiong, a member of the National Committee of the Chinese People’s Political 
Consultative (NCCPPC) heavily criticized that it was “one of the darkest and 
ugliest pages of the history of China’s juridical system”. About 20 human right 
activists claimed that the People’s Supreme Court should review Zhao’s case and 
find him “not guilty’ (<i>Ming Pao</i>, 24 December). In addition, <i>Times 
Weekly</i>, published by an official media group in Guangdong Province, selected 
Zhao as one of the 100 well known civilian in 2010, including those human rights 
lawyers and some signatories of Charter 08. The award speech stated that the 
authorities’ undetermined attitude on the Contaminated Milk Incident and Zhao’s 
case showed that the pursuit of social justice could not be repressed by 
imprisonment. Although that issue was later banned, it clearly showed that the 
general public was largely sympathetic towards Zhao. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to <i>
Xinhua News </i>dated 22 Nov, Zhao pleaded guilty and the authorities accepted 
his application for medical treatment outside prison. Afterwards, there has been 
no more news about him. On 10 Dec, it was suddenly disclosed that Zhao was 
allowed to have medical treatment, which led to Hong Kong media rushing to his 
apartment. However, the media was blocked by dozens of guards. What happened to 
Zhao still remains a puzzle. Zhao’s case proves that wrong cases always repeat 
and people have no legal rights. It absolutely needs people’s power to make a 
change. (22 Dec 2010)</span></p>

<span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><u>Postscript:</u></b> According to <i>Ming Pao</i> 
dated 29 Dec, the blog of “Home for Kidney Stones Babies” issued a notice by 
Zhao that he was under medical treatment and he “refuses to contact anyone and 
disturb my family, and wants to lead a normal life”. This is indeed dubious. He 
had been detained for one month and was forced to issue such kind of notice. The 
truth will be disclosed in the future. On the other hand, Wang Guangya, 
currently appointed as the director of Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the 
State Council of PRC, claimed that Zhao’s case has already been “finely 
resolved’, and defended that “the mainland’s independent juridical system should 
not be intruded”. When asked if the open letter by Hong Kong members of NPC 
violated the rule, Wang replied that it depended on the way of expression, but 
he emphasized that “the well water does not interfere with the river water”.</span></p>

<span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wong Kwok Kin, a Hong Kong member of NPC and a core 
member of The Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions, responded that “if an NPC 
member cannot interfere with HK matters or comment on the mainland affairs, what 
can he or she do?” Actually, all members of NPC and NCCPCC are merely 
instruments of raising hands to say yes, but never make any dissent. Their 
modest petition does not have any positive response which is really a tragedy of 
bureaucracy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 30 Dec 2010</span></p>
