<span lang="EN-US">In 2008, Liu Xiaobo drafted Charter 2008 which urged for 
China’s political reform, democracy, freedom and human rights and was signed by 
twelve thousand people. Later he was sentenced to 11 years’ imprisonment, in the 
words of the sentence, &quot;incitement to the overthrow of the state power and 
socialist system and the people’s democratic dictatorship.&quot; Liu fought for 
democracy through peaceful means, but the bureaucracy repressed the dissident 
voices in order that their political and economic privileges remain intact. This 
shows that Liu is deprived of rights of freedom of speech and publication which 
are stated in China’s Constitution. Two years ago, the author wrote an article 
on Liu, entitled “60 Years after the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and 
China’s Human Rights Status” (<i>October Review</i>, No 225). After Liu was 
imprisoned for two years, the Nobel Committee decided to award the Nobel Peace 
Prize 2010 to him. It not only recognizes his struggle but also protests again 
China’s repression. The deputy minister of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of 
PRC went to Norway to intervene, but failed. The Chinese authorities angrily 
opposed that the award signified an interference with China’s domestic affairs. 
Several hostile gestures came afterwards: Liu Xia, Liu’s wife, was forbidden to 
attend the award ceremony; dissident figures like Ding Zilin and her husband 
were under surveillance, and restaurants were not allowed to serve a table more 
than six clients. Furthermore, China prevented other countries from going to 
attend the ceremony. The award ceremony was held as scheduled. An empty chair 
was placed on the stage, and the Committee was responsible for keeping the 
prize, medal and money. As Ye Du, a writer, described, it “will lead to further 
fermentation of China’s democratic movement”. According to the history of the 
Nobel Peace Prize, there were at least four similar cases: in 1935, the 
Committee gave the award to

thing happened to

<span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On 5 Dec, in Hong Kong, 11 social groups declared a 
joint statement signed by 48 groups and more than one thousand individuals. On 
the newspaper, they urged for a demonstration: “Liu Xiaobo should be released! 
Human rights must be restored in China!” They made five claims: (1) we support 
the rights of Chinese citizens to promote Charter 2008! (2) We support Liu Xiao 
to receive the Nobel Peace prize (3) we request that the Chinese government must 
release Liu Xiaobo unconditionally. (4) we are concerned that the freedom of Liu 
Xia and other human rights defenders was limited after the award ceremony, so we 
request the Chinese authorities to cancel the surveillance measures; (5) we are 
concerned that all civilians have human rights and freedom that are guaranteed 
by the Constitution, so we request the Chinese authorities to release all 
political prisoners unconditionally. We think that the Chinese authorities 
should immediately release the dissidents in prison (such as Hu Jia) and human 
rights lawyers like Zhao Lianhai. Their human rights and freedom must be 
restored The Nobel Peace Prize is certainly related to the diplomacy and the 
ideology of the western powers, so that the Left should take a critical distance 
from it. However, Liu being awarded the Nobel Peace Prize is also a criticism of 
Chinese authorities; hence it can be an encouragement for the development of the 
democratic movement in China.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
