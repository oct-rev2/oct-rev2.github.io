	dominating China’s economy which was under the national “Five-Year-Plan”. 
	However, several years ago, the usual phase of “Five-Year-Plan” was changed 
	to “Five-Year-Schedule”, showing that national “Plan” could not control 
	market economy any more. In reality, the state-owned economic entities are 
	gradually marginalized, while 70% of private entities make huge profits and 
	exploit workers. Once the official claimed that China’s planned economy was

	as the National Department and Reform Commission, have jointly declared that 
	they would regulate the over-productions and redundancies of constructions

	Zhong Wei, Professor of Beijing Normal University, pointed out, “China’s 
	economy is ranked no. 3 in the world, but it is only 6.4% of the world 
	economy, or one-fourth of USA, and GDP of per person is out of top 100. The

	<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 11.0pt; color: black">Willy Lam, a Hong 
	Kong critic, provided some statistics about the situation of “rich 
	government and poor people”, for example, national revenues increased from 
	RMB 2000 billions of 2003 to over RMB 6000 billions in 2008. However, the 
	percentage of income of both the city and the countryside in GDP has been 
	decreasing. It decreased from 53% of 1999 to 41.4% of 2006, 15% less than 
	the developed countries. Sun Liping, Professor of Sociology of Tsinghua 
	University, stated that the gap of living standard between the city and the 
	countryside was 6 times, but the world standard was only 1.5 times. Worse 
	still, millions of peasant workers create a lot of wealth for the whole 
	country but they suffer serious diseases, due to polluted working conditions 
	and lack of labor insurance. It is estimated that 200 millions of workers 
	suffer from different kinds of occupational diseases. (5)</span></p>

	affected by the world financial crisis, China’s market economy confronts 
	problems such as an escalating inflation. The prices of staple food and 
	commodities, particularly property estate, have largely increased. Ordinary

	burden of the working people in China is ranked no.2 in the world. (6)</span></p>

	<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 11.0pt; color: black">One of the

	Zeng Xiangquan, the Dean of the School of Labor and Human Resources of 
	Renmin University, quoted the latest research of the Ministry of Finance and 
	pointed out that the national income distribution has been “in extremely 
	imbalance”, 10% of the richest families occupies 45% of the property of the 
	whole urban population, in contrast, 10% of the poorest families occupies 
	only 1.4% of the property of national population. Nowadays, in the income

	64.3% of the whole population. (7)</span></p>

	government has implemented a series of policies, valued of RMB 4000 
	billions, more or less encountered the global financial crisis and saved the 
	descending economic growth, but it worsened the balance of economic 
	structure. This year the government has invested in the state-owned 
	enterprises, composed of 95% of GDP growth. The phenomenons of redundancy 
	and over-production have appeared again, in that the enterprises of “highly 
	consumed energy and highly polluted” have rekindled, that seriously affect

	<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 11.0pt; color: black">In order to 
	stimulate national consumption for economic growth, the government carried 
	out various policies such as “electronic appliances are being sent to the 
	countryside”, “cars are being sent to the countryside”, and the exchange of 
	the newly appliances, etc. The policy of stimulating internal consumption of 
	2002 has still remained only at the stage of crying the slogans. Percentage 
	of consumption in the economic growth has gradually decreased. In accordance 
	with the perfect model of economic growth, consumption need is the engine of

	<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 11.0pt; color: black">Secondly, there 
	is an imbalance of income distribution. Due to low income, it directly 
	affects people’s capability of consumption. China’s financial revenue has 
	annually increased 20.4%, but the working class merely 15.7%, which is 
	obviously against the general will of consumption.</span></p>

	Great Leap Forward and People Commune movement led to three-year great 
	hunger. The Cultural Revolution was a disaster and the Democratic movement 
	of 1989 was violently suppressed. Wang Dan, the former student leader of

	discontentment among people, particularly the marginalized and suppressed 
	peasants. Some leaders of the ruling class attempted to make concessions to 
	grassroots people. Nevertheless, it was oppressed by the interested groups 
	and the privileged bureaucracy. Although the national leaders claim that it 
	should be “people-oriented”, there is no change at the ground level. 
	Dissents like Liu Xiaobo and legal-right protectionists like Tan Zuoren (a 
	lawyer), Huang Qi and Guo Quan were all oppressed and sent to prisons. This

	October Review</i>, no.213 of 2007. The more developed capitalism in China, 
	the more people suffered. This led to social conflicts and mass

	2005, Jianlong Steel Group (JSG), a Beijing private enterprise, became a 
	shareholder of TISG which has a history of 50 years old. JSG intentionally 
	planned to annex the state-owned enterprise. In 2007, TISG lost over RMB 10 
	billion and faced bankruptcy. In early 2009, JSG declared to retreat its 
	shareholdings from TISG. Then in March, workers complained about salary cut 
	and then went on demonstrations. In June, as soon as TISG gained a profit of 
	RMB 80 millions, JSG became again the shareholder of TISG. In July, 30 
	thousands of workers demonstrated on the street and had conflicts with the 
	police. Chen Guojun, the new chief manager, requested workers to resume work

	people narrated, in April 2009, TISG broke out a strike, opposing JSG’s 
	shareholding. Chen came back again to declare the policy of restructuring by 
	the new management that became the proximate cause. The workers complained 
	that they normally had a salary of RMB 1800-2000, but after JSG became the 
	shareholder, they only had a salary of RMB 600. Worse still, some of them 
	had only a salary of RMB 200-300. On the contrary, the chief manager had an 
	annual salary of RMB 3 millions, and other managers around RMB 1 million. 
	Some informants disclosed that the location of TISG was originally an 
	agricultural area, and most of workers were local peasants. For over 40 
	years, several generations of local people have worked for TISG. It was 
	definitely a disaster for the landless peasants when they suddenly became
