	</span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">Over the past thirty 
	years, China has a rapid economic growth but one of its costs is a 
	deteriorating environment. Ma Jun, director of Public and Environment 
	Research Center in Beijing, pointed out that China has confronted water 
	problems, such as water shortage, water pollution, damaged water resources, 
	among others. In north China, there are serve water shortages. Many cities 
	have over exploited underground water. The situation is not sustainable. In 
	south China, water resources are good but water pollution is very serious. 
	People do not have clean drinking water. According to the statistics, 300 
	millions of peasants of the whole country do not have clean and safe 
	drinking water, and one-fifths of cities cannot have qualified drinking 
	water.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 19.55pt; margin-left: 9.0pt; margin-right: 2.4pt; margin-top: 0cm; margin-bottom: .0001pt">
	<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">There are tremendous news 
	reports about water problems, for example, according to <i>South China Daily</i>, 
	dated 27 September 2009, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region had a serious 
	problem of agricultural water pollution and sewage. The whole region 
	produced more than 44 millions of tones of sewage, and around 6 millions of 
	rubbish. Facilities of sewage and rubbish treatment were backward. 
	“Evaporation of polluted water and rubbish gone with the wind” are common 
	phenomenon. Nowadays more than 19 millions of populations do not have clean 
	and safe water. There occurred intestinal infectious diseases in secondary 
	and primary schools, in which over 80% of cases caused due to drinking 
	polluted water.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 19.55pt; margin-left: 9.0pt; margin-right: 2.4pt; margin-top: 0cm; margin-bottom: .0001pt">
	<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">Moreover, the whole region used 
	pesticides and chemical fertilizers that exceed the safety standard. Only 
	around 30% of chemical fertilizers were used and pesticides 30-40%. The rest 
	flowed into the water or remained in the soil that polluted the soil, 
	surface water and underground water. Now in the whole region, the livestock 
	and poultry has produced around 600 millions of tones of sewage, which is 
	22.2% of the total (industry, domestic, and livestock and poultry), and it 
	becomes the main source of water pollution.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 19.55pt; margin-left: 9.0pt; margin-right: 2.4pt; margin-top: 0cm; margin-bottom: .0001pt">
	<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two days later,<i> 
	China’s Environment Daily </i>also reported that the Environmental 
	Department of Longan Township of Nanning Municipality in Guangxi province 
	received local people’s complaints that some wild fish died at the 
	conjuncture of Yan River of Longan Township and You River of Pingguo 
	Township of Baise Municipality. After investigation, it was verified that 
	Kaite Alcoholic Limited Company illegally added honey in the alcoholic 
	products and secretly installed drainage, through which 800 tones of 
	alcoholic sewage were poured into Rongdong without any treatment. Then the 
	sewage flowed into You River and aggravated its water quality.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 19.55pt; margin-left: 9.0pt; margin-right: 2.4pt; margin-top: 0cm; margin-bottom: .0001pt">
	<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">Drawing on the relevant laws of 
	prevention and penalties of water pollution, the Environmental Department 
	issued the biggest bill of penalty in the history of Guangxi Province, i.e., 
	RMB 625,110, and ordered the company to stop factory production and sewage, 
	as well as to demolish the illegal piles.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 19.55pt; margin-left: 9.0pt; margin-right: 2.4pt; margin-top: 0cm; margin-bottom: .0001pt">
	<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The deteriorating 
	ecology has exerted serious impacts on the livelihood of ordinary people. 
	Government is obliged to solve the problem. On 6 July, 2007, Pan Yue, deputy 
	director of China’s State Environmental Protection Administration (SEPA) was 
	interviewed by China Central Television (CCTV). He cried that “water 
	pollution is in a critical crisis”, “it’s our fault if we can’t solve that 
	problem”. He pointed out that 26% of 7 river systems of China were ranked as 
	the worst Category V, and 7 of 9 lakes were the same category, that meant it 
	could not be consumed by human or for agricultural use. In other words, 
	except the mainstreams of 7 river systems were fine, other tributaries 
	almost died, and 80% of lakes nearly died. Pan warned that “if we cannot 
	effectively solve water pollution, we will face the problem of unharmonious 
	society after the fulfillment of industrialization and urbanization.”</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 19.55pt; margin-left: 9.0pt; margin-right: 2.4pt; margin-top: 0cm; margin-bottom: .0001pt">
	<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">Pan Yue analyzed the causes of 
	water problem: first, many industrial complexes failed to pass the 
	environmental evaluation and to install the compatible facilitates of 
	pollution prevention. Research findings stated that 110 of the selected 126 
	industrial complexes failed to meet the requirement, which was 87.3%; 
	second, facilitates of sewage treatment did not function. 38 of the selected 
	75 sewage treatment plants were malfunctioned, which was 50.6%; third, the 
	unbalance of structural industrial policy, for example, there were 20 of 35 
	chemical industrial factories at the Longmen Industrial Complex in Shanxi 
	Province; fourth, the illegal drainage and excess of sewage, over 200 of the 
	selected 500 enterprises failed to meet the requirement; fifth, some 
	enterprise did not install prevention facilities; sixth, livestock and 
	poultry further polluted the water, for example, in 2007, cyanobacteria 
	blooms occurred in Taihu Lake, where there were over 300 industrial 
	enterprises such as chemical, dyeing, plating and pharmacy that caused water 
	pollution. Those enterprises included township enterprises, national as well 
	as transnational corporations. Ma Jun criticized that “the backyard of the 
	world factory will become the rubbish bin and drainage of the world”.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 19.55pt; margin-left: 9.0pt; margin-right: 2.4pt; margin-top: 0cm; margin-bottom: .0001pt">
	<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">Pan Yue’s article entitled “An 
	Analysis of Ecological Civilization of Socialism” (2006) argued that 
	“capitalism is the fundamental cause of the global ecological crisis. 
	Ecological crisis has become the new means of transferring the economic 
	crisis.”</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 19.55pt; margin-left: 9.0pt; margin-right: 2.4pt; margin-top: 0cm; margin-bottom: .0001pt">
	<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He commented that China 
	has confronted ecological crisis because China is copying modernization from 
	western developed countries. China has carried out the rapid economic growth 
	that western countries spent 100 years to achieve. Thus within 20 years, 
	China undoubtedly has the ecological crisis that western countries has 
	confronted over the past 100 years. China’s GDP growth and foreign direct 
	investment are top ranked, but the consumption of coals, oil, and steel, the 
	emission of CO2 and COD</span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 細明體">（</span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">chemical 
	oxygen demand</span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 細明體">）</span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">are 
	top ranked too. In the era of globalization, developed countries have 
	imposed ecological colonialism on developing countries through the transfer 
	of polluted industries; in China, the pollution in the east is transferred 
	to the west, the pollution of the city is transferred to the countryside, 
	the rich consumes and the poor suffers pollution of production. Pan 
	criticized that “some cadres in China have embraced the improper 
	developmentalism and are totally occupied by personal career that led to 
	social and environmental injustice. This violates the credentials of 
	socialism and is alienated from the socialism with Chinese characteristics.”</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 19.55pt; margin-left: 9.0pt; margin-right: 2.4pt; margin-top: 0cm; margin-bottom: .0001pt">
	<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">Pan argued that western 
	industrial civilization was out of religious reform, renaissance, and 
	technological revolution, but the utmost important reason was the expansions 
	of oversea colonies that largely helped western countries transfer the 
	internal social conflicts and contradictions to their overseas colonies. The 
	developed countries have only 15% of the world population but they occupy 
	over 80% of the world resources. They upgrade their own standard of the 
	environmental protection, but transfer the highly consumed and polluted 
	industries to the developing countries, in order to avoid the ecological 
	responsibility.</span></p>

	<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">Being the deputy director of 
	China’s State Environmental Protection Administration (SEPA), Pan Yue 
	publicly criticized capitalism. On the one hand, it showed that the ruling 
	class was highly concerned about the ecological crisis, but on the other 
	hand, it ironically proved that the logic of capital is still occupying the 
	mainstream society. The current environmental policy is very passive, that 
	refers to a popular saying that “develop now and clean-up later”. This is 
	only concerned about preventive methods and the imposition of legal 
	constraints. However, the nature of capital is the everlasting production 
	and reproduction that is embedded in industrialization and urbanization, 
	unstoppably exploit the nature. Hence, once the world factory still 
	functions, adopts the export-oriented industrial policy, and chases after 
	GDP growth, it is impossible to solve the existing ecological crisis. This 
	is the fundamental reason why the environmental policy cannot be completely 
	carried out, except only some trivial resolutions.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 19.55pt; margin-left: 9.0pt; margin-right: 2.4pt; margin-top: 0cm; margin-bottom: .0001pt">
	<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">The ecological civilization of 
	socialism is a perspective of the western leftists who criticize capitalism 
	and industrial civilization, not taken from economic standpoint, but 
	particularly from cultural aspects. Actually, in the 19<sup>th</sup> and 20<sup>th</sup> 
	centuries, Asian thinkers and social activists like Gandhi of India and 
	Liang Shuming, a Buddhist and Confucian of China, had already criticized the 
	“barbarian” western civilization. They commented that western society 
	worshiped individualism and chased after personal profits and competitions, 
	but they stated that the nature of human should be self-restricted and being 
	humble, concerned about ethics and friendship. And they urged for having 
	“non-violence” and “courtesy / rationality” as the driving force of social 
	transformation. Chinese ancient thinkers also teach people not to become 
	greedy, for example, in his book, <i>Moral Classics</i>, Laozi states that 
	human’s greedy will bring a disaster to the nature, “if anybody wants to 
	exploit the whole world, I think it will be ended up in disaster” (quoted 
	from Chapter 29). Moreover, “the largest disaster is greedy” (quoted from 
	Chapter 46). In a word, it will contribute to future development of human 
	beings if we re-interpret and activate the cultural thought of ancient 
	thinkers.</span></div>
