<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On 19 October 2017, on 
behalf of the 18<sup>th</sup> Central Committee of the Communist Party of China 
(CPC), Xi Jinping delivered a report at the 19<sup>th</sup> National Congress. 
He declared that ‘it is a meeting of great importance taking place during the 
decisive stage in building a moderately prosperous society in all respects and 
at a critical moment as socialism with Chinese characteristics has entered a new 
era”, and “the theme of the Congress is:&nbsp;Remain true to our original aspiration 
and keep our mission firmly in mind, hold high the banner of socialism with 
Chinese characteristics, secure a decisive victory in building a moderately 
prosperous society in all respects, strive for the great success of socialism 
with Chinese characteristics for a new era, and work tirelessly to realize the 
Chinese Dream of national rejuvenation”.</span></p>

<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">Xi spent more than two hours to 
present his report, in which the phrases “socialism with Chinese characteristics 
for a new era” was repeated many times, as if it were the reality that needs to 
be maintained. However, according to <i>A Simplified Dictionary of Political 
Economy</i> edited by Xu Dixin, “socialist system is a general term of socialist 
economic and political system based on the public ownership of production 
materials”, and “to abolish private property system is to cancel human 
exploitation”; hence, there is no socialist system in today’s China.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 17.0pt; layout-grid-mode: char">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">Since Deng Xiaoping advocated the 
policy of reform and open door, as well as capitalist market economy, to allow a 
minority of people to get rich first, both the public and the non-public sector 
of the economy competed to develop. At last, the non-public sector (i.e., the 
system of private property) bypassed largely the public sector of the economy. 
The Report disclosed that the CPC exaggerated the role of “socialist” public 
sector of the economy which had been implemented for a long time. However, the 
CPC has not yet changed. It continues to develop the non-public sector of the 
economy. The Report pledged “to take effective measures to prevent the loss of 
state assets”, but in reality, it was a failure, based on what had happened over 
the past years.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 17.0pt; layout-grid-mode: char">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Report stated that over 
the past five years, there were major achievements in economic development. The 
gross domestic product (GDP) rose from 54 trillion to 80 trillion yuan. This 
kind of fast economic growth included not only the figures of the growth of 
state-owned enterprises and the non-state-owned enterprises, but also the 
figures of investment capital. It was not merely about the production value.</span></p>

<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt; background: white">According to 
the&nbsp;<i>Cihai</i>, a large-scale&nbsp;</span><span lang="EN-US"><a title="Chinese dictionary" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_dictionary"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; background: white">Chinese

published by the Commercial Press, “Gross National Product (GNP) refers to one 
of the indices of national economic activities in capitalist countries. The 
total value of all products and services of all sectors of a country within a 
specific time (quarterly or annual) calculated in terms of currency” (page 27).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 17.0pt; layout-grid-mode: char">

</span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">This is different from the 
CPC’s calculation, which made the inputs of investment capital for production 
calculated as the outputs of production value. Hence, China’s GDP had increased 
sharply. Now the figure is around 6.5% to 7.8% every year, so China has 
maintained its position as the world’s second largest economy. This showed that 
the CPC liked to do grandiose things, but it turned out to be overambitious and 
unrealistic.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 17.0pt; layout-grid-mode: char">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 新細明體,serif">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">The Report stated that 
“party leadership is the fundamental guarantee for ensuring that the people run 
the country and governance in China is law-based”. In reality, it is the party 
which seizes the people’s power of running the country and of governing the 
country by law. Thus, there is merely one-party dictatorship.</span></p>

</span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">The Report showed off the 
achievements under the CPC’s leadership, particularly the booming economic 
development. China has adopted from the path of socialist economic development 
to capitalist market economy. However, China does not develop as well as other 
capitalist countries.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 17.0pt; layout-grid-mode: char">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The report claimed that “we 
have taken major steps in developing democracy and the rule of law. We have 
actively developed socialist democracy and advanced law-based governance. We 
have stepped up institution building across the board to make integrated 
advances in Party leadership, the running of the country by the people, and 
law-based governance; and we have continuously improved the institutions and 
mechanisms by which the Party exercises leadership. Steady progress has been 
made in enhancing socialist democracy; intraparty democracy has been expanded, 
and socialist consultative democracy is flourishing.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 17.0pt; layout-grid-mode: char">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 新細明體,serif">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 12.0pt">Actually, the so-called “the 
running of the country” by “the people and socialist democracy” are false, as 
all rights of democracy are deprived by the CPC which claims itself to be the 
law and implements party-based governance. For example, Hong Kong people are 
supposed to enjoy high degree of autonomy and democratic governance. The CPC 
takes charges of Hong Kong’ foreign affairs and diplomacy and sends its 
liberation army to Hong Kong only if necessary. Unfortunately, in recent years, 
the central government officials have claimed to </span>
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">exercise its overall jurisdiction 
over Hong Kong, that means to abolish its </span>
<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 12.0pt">high degree of autonomy. Xi 
reiterated that “w</span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">e have 
made fresh progress in work related to Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan. We have 
fully and faithfully implemented the principle of ‘one country, two systems’, 
and ensured that the central government <a name="_Hlk503083189">exercises its 
overall jurisdiction over Hong Kong</a> and Macao as mandated by China’s 
Constitution and the basic laws of the two special administrative regions.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 17.0pt; layout-grid-mode: char">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How come such a high-ranking 
party member and official broke the promise? The CPC did it indeed!</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 17.0pt; layout-grid-mode: char">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 新細明體,serif">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">In order to address people’s 
discontents, the Report proposed to</span><span lang="EN-US"> </span>

and improve</span><span lang="EN-US"> “</span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">living 
standards through development</span><span lang="EN-US">. </span>
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">The wellbeing of the people is the 
fundamental goal of development. We must do more to improve the lives and 
address the concerns of the people, and use development to strengthen areas of 
weakness and promote social fairness and justice. We should make steady progress 
in ensuring people’s access to childcare, education, employment, medical 
services, elderly care, housing, and social assistance. We will intensify 
poverty alleviation, see that all our people have a greater sense of fulfillment 
as they contribute to and gain from development</span><span lang="EN-US">…”</span></p>

</span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">The roots of people’s 
poverty are exactly the policy of the CPC: the implementation of capitalist 
market economy led to social polarization. The poor people are getting poorer 
and the number of the poor is increasing. A bit of alms is better than none. The 
state owns a tremendous financial surplus. It can donate billions of money to 
foreign countries, in contrast, the funding for poverty alleviation is only a 
few hundred millions. A drop in the ocean. Previously, a news report said that 
due to living in dire poverty, a village family with five members committed 
suicide together. A tip of iceberg.</span></p>

</span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">In order to create Xi 
Jinping’s individual cult, the central government has recruited a lot of writers 
who </span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">are good at eulogizing 
the ruler’s virtues and achievements. They spent a lot of time to fabricate a 
masterpiece with more than </span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 12.0pt">
twenty</span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt"> thousand words. The 
goal is to carry out dictatorship same as Mao Zedong. This is the ultimate 
agenda of the Report. A very calculative and remarkable device!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 20
