<span style="font-size: 12.0pt">China’s economy has bloomed for over 30 years 
since its policy of reform and open door. China is ranked Top 2 economic entity 
in the world. Unfortunately, public ownership, which is supposed to be the main 
sector of economy, is gradually surpassed by non-public ownership. There has not 
been any relevant data in official document until <i>Nanfang Daily</i>, dated 11 
March (quoted by <i>Wen Wei Po</i>, dated 12 March), discloses the truth. The 
article states that the non-public ownership of economy has started from 
nothing, then from weak to strong, and getting stronger and stronger. Nowadays, 
the non-public ownership accounts for over 90% of the main sector of market 
economy, produces over 60% of GDP, over 80% of employment, over 65% of fixed 
asset investment, and over 67% of Foreign Direct Investment. The article 
continues: due to those great achievements, we have no reason to change the 
current policy; in order to build a general well-off society, it is necessary to 
mobilize different sectors of society. ‘Any idea of negating public ownership or 
non-public ownership is all wrong, as it is not compatible to the interests of 
the majority or to the requirements of development.’</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 24.0pt; line-height: 200%; layout-grid-mode: char; margin-top: 30px">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt">The above figures show that the sector of public 
ownership, which was emphasized by CPC, is no longer the main sector of economy. 
It accounts for less than 10% of the market, produces less than 40% of GDP, less 
than 35% of fixed asset investment, and less than 20% of employment.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 24.0pt; line-height: 200%; layout-grid-mode: char; margin-top: 30px">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt">It seems that the Chinese government is 
reluctant to disclose those figures which may bring negative effects on the 
sector of public ownership. However, what <i>Nanfang Daily</i> has disclosed 
clearly proves that public ownership is no longer the main sector, and the 
authorities have also provided the non-public ownership a policy of development 
regulation. Ironically, it reiterates that ‘</span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; color: black">keeping 
public ownership as the mainstay of the economy and allowing diverse forms of 
ownership to develop side by side</span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; color: black"> 
which is the basic system of economy”, and “unswervingly encourage, support, and 
guide non-public ownership, which is the main direction of the policy of the 
Party and the country” (quoted from </span><i><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">
Wen Wei Po</span></i><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">, dated 12 March). The 
sector of non-public ownership has developed stronger than the public ownership. 
The latter is suppressed by the system of privatization. China is reinforced to 
become a capitalist country. It is tragic for CPC to make China develop like 
that. The last quotation of “the idea of negating non-public ownership”, 
discloses that there is disagreement to the government’s support for the 
economic development of the sector of non-public ownership. In reality, China 
has already become a capitalist country with the system of privatization revived 
and even dominant. However, the CPC still claims that China is a socialist 
country (with Chinese characteristics). For example, in November 2015, </span>
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; color: black">the CPC Central Committee</span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; color: black">’s
</span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; color: black">Proposal on Formulating the 
Thirteenth Five-year Plan (2016-2020) on National Economic and Social 
Development,</span><span class="apple-converted-space"><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: black">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; color: black">states 
that the Central Committee of CPC, with Comrade Xi Jinping as the General 
Secretary, reiterates adherence to socialism with Chinese characteristics.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; layout-grid-mode: char; margin-top: 30px">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">
This is absolutely not socialism that Marxism proposes with public ownership of 
production materials being the basic system. The socialist system is to abolish 
exploitation, to implement “from each according to his ability, to each 
according to his deeds” at the primary stage, and then “from each according to 
his ability, to each according to his needs.” Nowadays, what China has carried 
out is absolutely not socialism, but the revival of capitalist system. China has 
never realized the state of “from each according to his ability”, as there are 
massive unemployment and semi unemployment. The policy line of CPC has given up 
socialism, but it still insists to usurp the name of ‘socialism’. It is indeed a 
grave mistake and a betrayal!</span></p>
