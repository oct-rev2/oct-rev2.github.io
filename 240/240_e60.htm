points out that for the last 30 years, there are three kinds of soil problem: 
soil erosion, soil pollution, and soil degradation. The last two problems are 
directly related to soil quality. Industrial development and urban construction 
have developed rapidly, however, environmental regulations and resolution 
measures are not well established, which made soil pollution become worse. In 
addition, a change of use of fertilizers (from organic fertilizers to chemical 
fertilizers), abuses of fertilizers, herbicides and pesticides, lots of plastic 
sheeting, among others, have caused soil deteriorating, high acidity, hardening, 
and the imbalance of nutrients and microorganisms. This has led to a series of 
problems such as the deteriorating quality of farm products, low production, and 
high amount of heavy metal.</span></p>

<span style="font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From April 2005 to December 2013, China has 
started the first investigation of national soil pollution. In April 2014, 
Communiqu&eacute; of Investigation of National Soil Pollution was issued, which covered 
all arable land, parts of forestry, grassland, unused land, and construction 
land, with a total of around 6.3 million square kilometers. It stated that “in 
general, the situation of soil environment is not optimistic. Some regions of 
land are seriously polluted, the quality of arable land is terrible, waste land 
of industrial and mining areas are clearly problematic……The degree of soil 
pollution has four categories: slight pollution, 11.2%; light pollution, 2.3%; 
medium pollution, 1.5%; and serious pollution, 1.1%.......From the distribution 
of pollution, the land in the south is more serious than the north.”</span></p>

<span style="font-size: 12.0pt">Chen Nengchang remarks that soil is rare and 
strategic resources, as well as the base of national and human livelihood. 
However, in the progress of development, we do not pay enough respects to soil; 
when we face the question of soil governance, we do not have basic understanding 
about soil. He explains that in principle, two questions should be taken into 
consideration: One, the degree of seriousness of soil pollution; second, the use 
of land after soil improvement. Soil is a highly imbalanced and complicated 
system. Firstly, we should conduct scientific analysis of soil structure, 
micro-organisms, among others. Based on the result, we should design different 
strategies and goals for different areas. Generally speaking, if the land is 
used for crop production and involved in human food chain, we should raise the 
standard of regulation. Now there is still room to improve soil management in 
respect of ecology. In actual cases, we should also consider ecological 
environment in specific areas, and the effects on specific food chain. In China, 
the current standard of soil quality was set in 1995. Although some standards 
are very loose (such as lead), it is the most rigid standard of the world 
(particularly cadmium and mercury).</span></p>

<span style="font-size: 12.0pt">He thinks that there are good suggestions of 
macro-framework of the Plan, for example, the establishment of surveillance 
network on soil pollution, different managements of arable land according to the 
degree of seriousness, reinforcement of protection of unpolluted land, among 
others. However, the key point is that there is lack of data about soil 
pollution, such as the scale of polluted land and their locations, the scale of 
polluted land with “safe use”. So he cannot predict the workload and the 
difficulty of feasibilities.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 24.0pt; line-height: 200%; layout-grid-mode: char; margin-top: 30px">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt">There are no accurate figures in the 2014 
Communiqu&eacute; so the reality of soil pollution is still unknown. After the incident 
of soil pollution at Changzhou Foreign Language College in April 2016, Chen 
Jining, the minister of Ministry of Environmental Protection, declared to 
conduct a comprehensive survey on national soil pollution. The first clause of 
“Ten Clauses on Soil” mentions the tasks to investigate the scale of polluted 
arable land, distribution, and the impacts on farm products before 2018; to 
identify the distributions of and environmental risks of polluted land caused by 
large enterprises before 2020. </span></p>

as chemicals, mining and metals.&nbsp;Of these,&nbsp;3,998 were state-controlled and 502 
non-state controlled, and 729 industrial zones home to the same industries. 
These locations were then marked on a map of China.</span></p>

<span style="font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chen Huaiman, a well-known soil 
scientist and a senior researcher of Nanjing Soil Research Institute of China 
Academy of Sciences, remarks that only the government can put “Ten Clauses on 
Soil” into practice. He explains that the establishment of surveillance network 
of soil quality should be reliable to the grassroots units. Over the whole 
country, the Ministry of Environmental Protection has its surveillance units, 
the Ministry of Agriculture has its agro-environmental units and soil fertility 
units. The main issue is how they can implement their obligations and how they 
can join and work together. This is indeed a task of government.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; layout-grid-mode: char; margin-top: 30px; background: white">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In general, the seriously polluted land 
is seldom caused by peasants themselves. The origins of pollution are always due 
to factories or mining. The Government should make a compensation system that 
the government pays the right of land use and carries out the principle of “who 
pollutes, who pays”. Only the government can put the policy into effective use.</span></p>
