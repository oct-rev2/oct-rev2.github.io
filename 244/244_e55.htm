<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">In March 2018, Tam Yiu-chung, a 
newly-appointed member of China’s National People’s Congress Standing Committee, 
said that candidates may be barred from running for seats in Hong Kong’s 
Legislative Council&nbsp;</span><span lang="EN-US"><a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="https://www.hongkongfp.com/2018/03/20/hongkongers-may-barred-elections-end-one-party-dictatorship-slogan-says-top-beijing-delegate/"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">if

implying a violation of China’s Constitution. Tam denied he was speaking on 
behalf of central government officials. He claimed that he spoke his own 
opinion.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 17.0pt; layout-grid-mode: char">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Afterwards, Chen Sixi, a 
vice-director of the Central People’s Government Liaison Office in Macau, who is 
also expected to be appointed as the director of the Macau Basic Law&nbsp;Committee, 
echoed Tam’s viewpoint. Chen claimed that “the </span>
<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 12.0pt">C</span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">onstitution 
is the fundamental law of the country and is applied in the whole country. 
Although Hong Kong is a Special Administrative Region, residents must respect 
the Constitution and defend the authority of the Constitution – this is the same 
in Hong Kong, there is no difference in the two systems.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 17.0pt; layout-grid-mode: char">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On 25 April, Wang Guangya, 
the former Director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office suggested that 
people who asked to “end one-party dictatorship” should not be qualified to 
stand for Legislative Council (LEGCO) elections. Such a slogan not only violates 
the Constitution, and it is also an illegal behavior.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 17.0pt; layout-grid-mode: char">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, it is exactly the 
existing ruling group that violates the constitution. They have implemented the 
one-party bureaucratic dictatorship which completely controls party, state, and 
the military, and deprives people of democratic rights based on the 
Constitution. Other parties within the so-called coalition government become 
rubber stamps who cannot supervise and intervene. The Communist Party of China 
(CPC) rejected socialism and planned economy and changed to embrace capitalist 
market economy which led to all levels of bureaucracy becoming corrupted.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 24.0pt; line-height: 17.0pt; layout-grid-mode: char">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">CPC has implemented one-party 
bureaucratic dictatorship which made so many mistakes and brought disasters to 
the country and the people. Why does it not end immediately? Why can’t it change 
to a government elected by the people of the whole country?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 17.0pt; layout-grid-mode: char">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; People have sharp eyes. 
They have already proposed it during the Democratic Movement of 1989 and 
June-Fourth Massacre. According to its five operational goals, Hong Kong 
Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China (HK Alliance) 
calls to end&nbsp;one-party dictatorship and build a democratic China. All Chinese, 
including people of Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan, should enjoy democratic 
rights, including freedom of speech, criticisms, and full suffrage (political 
franchise and candidate eligibility). Any member of LEGCO who proposes to end 
one-party dictatorship should not be disqualified. The proposal should be voted 
for adaptation by the majority of LEGCO members. Any vote of disqualification of 
LEGCO member should also be passed with the two-thirds of those present. This 
cannot be decided by people like Chen Sixi and Wang Guangya.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 24.0pt; line-height: 17.0pt; layout-grid-mode: char">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">The leadership of HK Alliance will 
not surrender to Wang and his allies. On 4 June 2018, in a candlelight vigil, 
the HK Alliance continues to call “to end one-party dictatorship and build a 
democratic China”, in memory of those democratic warriors, as always. We believe 
every year, everybody actively attends the candlelight vigil for June Fourth 
Democratic Movement, in response to Wang and his allies by 
action.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;28 May
