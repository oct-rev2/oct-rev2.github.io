Third Plenary Session of the 18th Communist Party of China (CPC) Central 
Committee</span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 11.5pt"> decides to set up 
a national security commission, in order to improve national security system and 
national security strategy. Since 1949, China has set up the Ministry of Public 
Security (MPS), which is under the State Council. Why to set up a new security 
commission now? This means the MPS is no longer capable of dealing the national 
security. Xi Jinping needs a new institute directly under his control in order 
to reinforce his power.</span></p>

<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 11.5pt">CPC implements capitalist economy 
which brings both economic growth and social polarization. According to a survey 
conducted by a research centre of Peking University. The difference between the 
rich and the poor is 234 times. Officials are corrupted. Social unrest is 
everywhere. Environmental degradation endangers public health. Inflation is 
serious and living costs increase sharply. People suffer from the difficulties 
of livelihood, housing, health care, employment, and education.</span></p>

<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 11.5pt">The government has financial 
surplus of RMB 16 trillions. It spends RMB 700 billion on keeping social 
security, meanwhile, the budget for health care and education is merely RMB 50 
billion. This arouses people＊s grievances and resistances, such as bombings. 
From June to November 2013, there were four cases of bombings by Eastern Turks 
who fought for independence. They intrigued a bomb near Tiananmen Square before 
the </span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 11.5pt">Third Plenary Session</span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 11.5pt"> 
started. This shows political uncertainty.</span></p>

<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 11.5pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We object terrorist 
behaviors which endanger innocent people. We should adopt the strategy of mass 
mobilization to change social injustice. China should learn from USSR that 
during Lenin＊s ruling period, different ethnic groups have their own 
independence. There was ethnic harmony.</span></p>

<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 11.5pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now China economy is ranked 
after the US which makes surrounding countries uncomfortable. Japanese 
accusation of ※China＊s Threat§, particularly refers to the disputes at the South 
Sea. This needs a national security commission to handle the complicated 
circumstances. China concentrates on making friendship with capitalist 
countries, but does not support the working class and working parties in other 
countries to overthrow their capitalist regimes. If so, they could help China in 
return. Only the path to the proletariat revolution can help China avoid from 
isolation. The Commission does not want to choose this path. Thus, it will be 
exactly the roots of social instability. </span>
