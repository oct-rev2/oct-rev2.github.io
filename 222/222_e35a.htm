	<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 10.0pt">Whilst the Chinese Communist 
	Party is stressing the need to build a society of harmony, many incidents 
	indicate serious disharmony. One manifestation is the clashes in interest 
	between local cadres and the masses. The land issue stands out as a major 
	issue. The homes of local residents are demolished, or the farmland is 
	appropriated, and then the land is sold at a high price to developers, with 
	little compensation for the residents or peasants. Grievances lead to 
	protests and resistances.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: 12.8pt">
	<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 10.0pt">In Shantou City in Guangdong 
	Province, unrest again broke out during the week of May 1, 2007. Villagers 
	of Guyao Township, Chaoyang District suspected the rural cadres of 
	corruption in the land deals, and organized squads to assault the homes of 
	cadres, rob their household items, and destroy police cars. (Hong Kong Ming 
	Pao, May 8) The unrest continued for a week, and spread to Tongyu Township 
	in the vicinity. Several hundred villagers besieged the village 
	administration building and a factory, and demanded the removal of the 
	factory. Illegal land deals in the village are rampant; 60-70% of the 
	farmland has been sold to factory owners to build factories, and some 
	peasants have not got any compensation. Villagers claimed that it was 
	general knowledge that every village party secretary had amassed tens of 
	millions of fortune. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: 12.8pt">
	<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 10.0pt">The authorities have adopted a 
	restrained attitude in order to calm things down. Two village cadres were on 
	the wanted list, but they had both disappeared. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: 12.8pt">
	<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 10.0pt">The incident shows that 
	firstly, even if the party central authorities issue many resolutions and 
	orders to discipline corrupt cadres, corruption is still rampant in the 
	local. This is induced by the bureaucracy. Anti-corruption resolutions are 
	mere empty words on paper. Secondly, the administration’s work report also 
	stresses the need to defend the people’s livelihood and prevent illegal 
	occupation of land, and yet the illegalities are happening everywhere. 
	Thirdly, the Right to Property Bill was adopted by the National People’s 
	Congress in March 2007, yet the right to property of villagers and urban 
	ordinary folk is not protected from the violations of big industrial and 
	commercial interests. This is probably the characteristics of Chinese 
	capitalism.</span></p>
