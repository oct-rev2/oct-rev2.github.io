	<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 10.0pt">Upsurges in Shantou City in 
	Guangdong Province occurred in the first week of May 2007. Within ten days, 
	riots erupted in 8 villagers in Bobai County in the neighbouring province of 
	Guangxi, where villagers broke into the government buildings and burnt 
	things down, and even beat to death some officials in charge of birth 
	control. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
	<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 10.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The incident 
	originated with a birth control conference in Guangxi Province early this 
	year. Bobai County was named as seriously problematic in excessive births, 
	and the authorities were ordered to redress the problem. Hence, the Bobai 
	authorities issued 28 birth control policies this year, stressing that 
	“iron-like resolution, means and discipline” will be imposed against birth 
	control violators.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
	<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 10.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some measures 
	included: out of quota births after 1980 have to pay a fine of 10,000 to 
	70,000 yuan (USD1=7.5 yuan), regardless of whether they have previously paid 
	any fines. Those who cannot pay will have their household items removed and 
	pigs and poultry seized; household items not worth anything would be 
	smashed. All government officials are given a quota of completing one case 
	of contraception operation on a woman and collection of a fine of 500 yuan 
	before the end of August. (Wen Hui Pao May 22, 23) When the local cadres 
	implement the policies with force, it induced serious resentment and rage of 
	the villagers. It is reported that tens of thousands of people rioted.

	<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 10.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When social 
	disparities are serious, and peasants are already leading a difficult life, 
	the further extortion of money from the peasants by the local authorities 
	drives peasants to rioting. In Bobai, faced with the riots, the government 
	on the one hand dispatched the military troops, and on the other hand 
	suspended the fines. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
	<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 10.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such measures of 
	greed and indifference from the authorities have intensified the tensions 
	between the government and the people. The Bobai riot is only one among 
	many, and made visible because of media reports. According to the government 
	statistics, from 1994 to 2004, within a decade, mass unrest incidents have 
	risen from 10,000 cases to 74,000 cases, which is an annual increase of 
	22.2%. The number of people involved has risen from 730,000 man-times to 
	3.76 million man-times, which is an annual increase of 17.8%. This is the 
	state of “harmony” in today’s China.</span></p>
