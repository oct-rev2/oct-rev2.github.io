<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 11.0pt">This year is the anniversary of 23 
years of Tiananmen Massacre. As always, there was a candlelight vigil at the 
Victoria Park of Hong Kong. Its aim is to remember the victims who fought for 
democracy and against government corruption. 180,000 people attended the rally 
and the number broke the record. The Victoria Park was full of candlelight and 
became ‘a sea of conscience’. Many cities in mainland China also had some 
commemorative activities. Many Hong Kong people attended the rally:</span></p>

<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 11.0pt">Before the vigil, 40 members of the

<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 11.0pt">Not only in Hong Kong, other cities 
in mainland China also had actions to commemorate June-4 Massacre.</span></p>

</span>In Guiyang City of Guizhou Province, on the square, some people openly 
held up a banner and cried out the slogan: accountability to the Massacre and 
abolition of political suppression. The demonstration lasted for two hours and 
attracted a lot of onlookers. The authority did not intervene.</span></p>
<p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: -18.0pt; layout-grid-mode: char; line-height: 150%; margin-left: 18.0pt; margin-top: 30px">

</span>In Nanping City of Fuzhou of Fujian Province, 16 people held banners 
saying “Rehabilitation of June-4” and “We Are Gravediggers for Greedy and 
Corrupt Officials”. Many people were attracted to the demonstration.</span></p>

</span>Some netizens were arrested by public security, for example, Huang Bing, 
a netizen from Zhengzhou City, was arrested because he put a sticker of “Not to 
Forget June-4” on a bookstore. Sun Desheng, human rights activist from Guangzhou 
City, was summoned and his house was searched.</span></p>

</span>In Shenzhen, some young people gathered together to commemorate the 
victims of June-4.</span></p>
<p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: -18.0pt; layout-grid-mode: char; line-height: 150%; margin-left: 18.0pt; margin-top: 30px">

</span>In Beijing City, it was announced that “the wartime operation mechanism 
and equivalent defense system” was turned on. Even though under residential 
surveillance, Sun Wenqing, a retired professor of Shangdong University, went out 
to hold a banner of “Rehabilitation of June-4” which later was grabbed by public 
security. The website of Jasmine Revolution urged mainland Chinese to wear black 
clothes and black glasses, then to go for a walk on the square at 2pm on June 4.</span></p>

</span>In the USA, some mainland Chinese students, who were born after 1980s, 
wrote a joint letter to Hu Jintao and Xi Jinping, requesting to vindicate the 
June-4 incident at the coming 18<sup>th</sup> National Congress of the Communist 
Party of China.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="layout-grid-mode: char; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 30px">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 11.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are more similar 
activities that have not been reported. It is impossible for the authorities in 
the near future to take an initiative to admit to the bloody crackdown. Only 
when people unite together will there be a change. The commemorative activities 
at different places obviously show that people are working together for a common 
goal.</span></p>
