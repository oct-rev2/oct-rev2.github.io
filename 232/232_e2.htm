<b><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 14.0pt">Comments on China’s New Criminal 
Procedure Law&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Zhang Kai</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="layout-grid-mode: char; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 30px">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 11.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In March 2012, the National 
People’s Congress of China passed the revised Criminal Procedure Law. Shortly 
after the announcement of the draft amendments, the law had already aroused 
discontents among legal scholars, general public and even some Congress delegates.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="layout-grid-mode: char; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 30px">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 11.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
controversy refers to two articles. First, the amended and approved version of Article 73:
“Residential 
surveillance shall be carried out in the residence of the criminal suspect or 
defendant. When there is no fixed residence, it may be carried out in a 
designated abode. In cases involving crimes of endangering state security, 
terrorist activity, or especially serious bribery, if carrying out [residential 
surveillance] in the residence [of the criminal suspect or defendant] has the 
potential to interfere with the investigation, it may also be carried out in a 
designated abode following approval by the procuratorate or public security 
organ at a higher level”; 
and according to Article 77, “Residential surveillance should not be longer than 
six months.” The original version was: “the criminal suspect or defendant of the 
residential surveillance is not allowed to get out of the residence unless with 
the approval of the authorities” That meant residential surveillance was 
conducted in the fixed residence.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="layout-grid-mode: char; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 30px">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 11.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many people oppose it. Wang 
Mingwen, an NPC delegate and law professor of Xichang College, strongly requests 
to cancel that residential surveillance can be conducted other than the fixed 
residence because it will provide conditions for the use of torture and forced 
confessions (quoted from <i>Apple Daily</i>, 12 March 2012) Moreover, ‘crimes 
of endangering state security’ 
can be used as an excuse, the deputy editor of <i>Finance</i> magazine 
criticizes, the wording of “state security” is like a basket into which you can 
put anything.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="layout-grid-mode: char; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 30px">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 11.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another controversial 
amendment is Article 83: “</span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 11.0pt; color: #222222">Within 
24 hours of detention, a relative of the detainee shall be notified, except when 
it is impossible to give notice or in cases involving crimes of endangering 
state security or terrorist activity, when notification has the potential to 
interfere with the investigation. When the circumstances of interference with 
the investigation no longer exist, a relative of the detainee shall be notified 
immediately”, 
and according to Article 89: “the period of detention can be 7 days”. This is 
commonly called “secret arrests”. Chen Youxi, director of Human Rights Committee 
of the National Lawyers Association, anticipates, “the legalization of secret 
arrests will lead to numerous cases of secret arrests. The consequence will be 
very serious.” </span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 11.0pt">(quoted from
<i>Apple Daily</i>, 12 March 2012).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="layout-grid-mode: char; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 30px">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 11.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wang Youjin, former chair 
professor of the University of Political Sciences and Law, also points out that 
the police should notify any relative of a detainee, which is social consensus 
of democracy. If the law of secret arrest is passed, it will be a trap to 
mainland Chinese, Taiwanees and Hong Kong people. Furthermore, Allen Lee, a 
former Hong Kong District NPC delegate, criticizes that the law is a 
retrogression.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="layout-grid-mode: char; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 30px">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 11.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The waves opposing Article 
73 (as well as Article 83) continuously emerge in mainland society. An on-line 
research showed that 93% of population supported the suspension of the vote on 
Article 73, but the research outcome was soon deleted. Some mainland legal 
scholars also complain that Article 73 limits freedom of speech, that 
residential surveillance at an unknown place may refer to prison, and that an 
arrest without notifying a relative is same as a secret arrest. It violates the 
law of human rights.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="layout-grid-mode: char; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 30px">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 11.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In spite of the widespread 
opposition, the amended CPL was passed. Of 
a total of 2,856 votes, 2,639 voted in favor, 160 voted against, and 57 
abstained. This shows that 
the NPC delegates are simply rubber stamps. It is a page of retrogression in the 
history of human rights in China. Not long ago, Chen Guangcheng, a blind lawyer 
defending human rights, had restored his citizen status but still suffered from 
a long time of residential surveillance. Even though he fled to the USA, his 
family in Shangdong Province has suffered from torture and persecution. This new 
amended Criminal Procedure Law allows those ‘local lords’, in the name of 
enforcing the law or defending national security, to suppress people’s human 
rights, freedom and democracy. In other words, the one-party- bureaucracy is 
covered with a coat of legalization. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 28 April 2012</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="layout-grid-mode: char; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 30px">

<p class="MsoNormal" style="layout-grid-mode: char; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 30px">
<b><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">Postscript: </span></b>
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 11.0pt">The sudden death of Li Wangyang, a 
committed activist of Democratic Movement of 1989, proves that the local 
bureaucracy ignores law and justice. The local authorities announced that Li 
hanged himself in the hospital. But there were many doubts. When he was found 
dead, his feet were on the ground. He had not committed suicide in jail even 
under sustained torture for more than 20 years. The local authorities forced his 
sister to agree to quick cremation. This obviously violated the new Criminal 
Procedure Law that forbids forced confession and evidence elimination. Li’s case 
shocked mainland China and overseas countries. In Hong Kong, the Chief 
Executive, high ranking officials and many NPC delegates, all urged the Central 
government to investigate into the case. As the corpse had already been 
cremated, how can the truth be found? But Hong Kong people have insisted on 
getting the truth out on this case.</span></p>
