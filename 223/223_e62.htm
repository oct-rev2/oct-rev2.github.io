<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 16.0pt">A Critique 
of the Report of the 17th Congress of the CCP </span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Zhang Kai</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 24.0pt"><span lang="EN-US">The 17<sup>th</sup> 
Congress of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) adopted the Report made by Hu 
Jintao. The 30,000-word report was full of nice clich&eacute;, and the new catch-phrase 
of Hu Jintao – the stress on a “scientific concept of development”, was written 
into the Party Constitution, to be parallel to the theoretical contributions of 
Marxism, Maoism, Dengism, and Jiang Zemin’s “idea of three representatives”.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 24.0pt"><span lang="EN-US">While the 
Report admits that China “is and will for a long time remain at the preliminary 
stage of socialism”, it stresses scientific development for social harmony, and 
vice versa. Even if we do not contest it with the Marxist concept of class 
struggle in human history, we will see that the social contradictions are 
accelerating today on China’s reversion to capitalism. The Report acknowledges 
that China’s productivity level is not high, structural problems exist, the 
widening income gaps are not improving, there is a “considerable” number of 
rural and urban poor and low income population, reconciling various interests is 
difficult, the agricultural basis is weak, and the tasks for reducing the 
rural-urban gaps and the regional disparities are still arduous.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Report chooses to be 
ambiguous over the negative situation. For example, how big is the 
“considerable” number of poor population in China, will they move into a state 
of “well-being” in the next 13 years, can rural questions receive enough 
attention, and can differences and contradictions incurred by the market reform 
be dealt with? All these questions are left without solutions. The Report also 
points out further problems, including: excessive price paid by resource 
environment due to economic growth, labour security, income distribution, 
education and health, production safety, law and order, and among the party 
ranks, problems of formalism, bureaucratism, corruption, extravagance are still 
“relatively serious”. The Report pledges to actualize a general society of 
well-being by the year 2020, with a per capita income of USD 2400, which would 
be 200% that of 2000, which was USD 800. It is dubious if such a pledge to bring 
a general uplifting of livelihood for the entire population will come true, 
especially when the panacea for such a development is to further develop the 
market economy.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Guangdong, there has been 
continuing development of the privately owned enterprises, which now comprise 
two-thirds of all enterprises in the province. At the same time, state and 
collectively owned enterprises have been on the decline for nine years.<a name="_ednref1" title href="#_edn1"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[1]</span></span></a> 
The Director of the State Council State-owned Assets Monitoring Committee said 
that the shareholding reform of central enterprises will be accelerated in the 
next three years, reducing the number from the current 155 to 80-100. Up to the 
end of 2006, these central enterprises had a total asset of 12.2 trillion yuan.<a name="_ednref2" title href="#_edn2"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[2]</span></span></a></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With their ascending economic 
might, capitalists would want more political power. A recent survey with private 
entrepreneurs indicates that 28.8% feel that the most urgent work is to become a 
people’s deputy or a consultative committee member. Many young entrepreneurs 
also strive to become CCP members. Of the 10,773 new party members in 2006, 
1,554 were entrepreneurs. At the 17<sup>th</sup> CCP Congress, the media noted 
30 representatives of the “new economic and new social organizations” 
representing RMB 10 trillion private assets. Most of them hold huge assets, some 
up to several billion yuan.<a name="_ednref3" title href="#_edn3"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[3]</span></span></a> 
Critics have pointed out that over 20 red capitalists or former bosses now 
converted to high ranking officials have become members or alternate members of 
the CCP Central Committee, and not one representative of workers or peasants 
have made their way into the central power.<a name="_ednref4" title href="#_edn4"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[4]</span></span></a>. 
Statistically, the CCP has not revealed the percentage of such entrepreneur 
members. On the eve of the 17<sup>th</sup> Congress, the composition of the CCP 
membership was announced by the CCP Organizational Division, that up to the end 
of June 2007, worker members numbered 7.96 million, and comprised 10.8% of the 
total membership, those from the agricultural, husbandry and fishery sectors 
were 31.5%, cadres, enterprise managers, professionals and technicians were 
29.1%, retired persons were 19.4%...<a name="_ednref5" title href="#_edn5"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[5]</span></span></a> 
Probably the entrepreneur members were included in the sector of enterprise 
managers, or under the category of 5% “others”.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the question of 
democracy, the Report repeats the empty slogan of “firmly upholding socialist 
democracy”, while subordinating this to “firmly upholding the party’s 
leadership”. There is no change to the longstanding one-party dictatorship. 
However, there is more and more articulation of protest against the lack of 
democracy for the people. Mr Xie Tao, the former vice-president of the Renmin 
University of China, published an article in Yan Huang Chun Qiu, a magazine in 
China, in February 2007 to say that the political reform cannot be further 
procrastinated. Mr Wu Min, professor of the CCP Shanxi Province party School, 
wrote an article “There is no Communist Party without democracy”, and asserted 
that the “central root of the illness” lies in the over-concentration of power 
of the political system. Hence, despite some younger personnel being brought 
into the Party leadership, there will not be any fundamental change to the basic 
political line of the CCP, and its bureaucratic way of rule.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There have been many reports of 
mass unrests and protests, resulting in confrontation with the police. Here are 
just a few examples of such unrests in the months preceding the 17<sup>th</sup> 
Congress:</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">May 30: around 1,000 workers in Shenzhen 
went on strike, which spread and was joined by over 8,000 workers on June 2; 
this was the biggest strike in Shenzhen’s history;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">June 1: about 20,000 to 30,000 citizens 
of Xiamen City took to the streets to protest the building of the PX chemical 
factory; forcing the government to cancel the project;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Early June: in Chongqing, an old flower 
hawker was beaten and seriously injured by the hawker control squads, causing a 
riot of several thousand people;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Early June: in Inner Mongolia, over 
5,000 residents clashed with the police on removal issues;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">June 18: 20,000 people calshed with the 
police in Zhejiang on removal issues;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">June 29: in Sichuan Province, over 3,000 
workers went on strike to protest the corruption and incompetence of the 
state-owned enterprise;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">July 18: in Jinzhou City of Liaoning 
Province, over 1,000 workers of the public transport company went on strike to 
protest privatization of the company, causing a total paralysis of the public 
transport;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">July 30: over 13,000 taxis went on 
strike for 5 days;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">August 21: about 10,000 workers went on 
strike in Shenzhen to protest doubling of workload and reduction to almost half 
of their wages;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">August 24: about 2,000 villagers clashed 
with the police when they tried to prevent the building of a power plant;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">September 27: in Shanwei of Guangdong 
Province, several thousand villagers who had been conducting their struggle for 
two years, clashed with the police in their attempt to prevent the building of a 
power plant.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such incidents are many, and 
they are just the tip of the iceberg of the resistance of the masses in defense 
of their livelihood rights under the encroachment of so-called “development”. 
The CCP cannot be expected to give up its power or its privileges. Hoping that 
it will reform itself is an illusion. It is up to the masses to resist the 
current injustices, and fight for their own better future.</span></p>
