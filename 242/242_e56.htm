<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 150%">In fact, after 
Deng Xiaoping adopted the policy of reform and open-door, China has marched 
towards the capitalist market economy. With the economic growth, nonpublic 
sector has developed prosperously and even takes more advantages. Drawing from a 
news report of <i>Wen Wei Po</i>, dated 12 March 2016, which quoted from <i>
Nanfang Daily</i>, dated 11 March, the author points out that nowadays nonpublic 
sector accounts for over 90% of the market, produces over 60% of GDP, takes over 
80% of employment, owns over 90% of fixed assets, and makes over 67% of overseas 
direct investment (please see <i>October Review</i> no. 240). All these show 
that the public sector is no longer the core of Chinese economy, or “the main 
part” claimed by the CCP. It has already been replaced by the nonpublic sector.</span></p>

<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 150%">Socialism means 
a society based on public ownership of means of production. At the moment, China 
is a society largely based on private ownership. The primary stage of socialism 
is one in which everybody has a job, from <span style="background: white">each 
according to his ability, and to each according to his contribution. In the 
higher stage, each according to his ability, to each according to his need. 
China is far from either.</span></span></p>

<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 150%">The report 
admitted that the unemployment rate was 4.02% at the end of 2016, which was the 
lowest rate for over several years. Last year, there was over 80% of employment 
rate. In other words, there was still nearly 20% of unemployment rate. In 2015, 
the official statistics showed that the number of the rural poor was 70 million. 
In 2016, the number reduced by 1.24 million. Until 2020, China is expected to 
completely accomplish poverty alleviation. The report claimed that there were

<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 150%">The Report 
proposed that in future, the government would further support the nonpublic 
sector and even declared that, “we will do more to energize the nonpublic 
sector. We will thoroughly implement the policies and measures for supporting 
the development of the nonpublic sector. We will work actively to develop a new 
relationship between government and business. We will encourage nonpublic 
enterprises to participate in State-Owned Enterprise (SOE) reforms. We must 
ensure equal rights, equal opportunities, and fair rules, and further expand 
market access to the nonpublic sector. All industries and sectors for which 
entry is not explicitly prohibited by laws or regulations should be open to 
different types of market entities; all industries and sectors that are open to 
overseas investment should be open to Chinese private capital; and all 
unjustified activities that impede fair market competition should be stopped.”</span></p>

<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 150%">Moreover, the 
Report stated that “we will improve the property rights protection system. 
Protecting property rights means protecting labor, protecting invention and 
innovation, and protecting and developing productive forces. We will work faster 
to improve the property rights protection system and protect in accordance with 
law the property rights of economic entities under all forms of ownership and 
the property rights of citizens. We will encourage people to start businesses, 
make innovations, and create wealth, and we will inspire and protect 
entrepreneurship, and ensure that entrepreneurs can run their businesses and 
make investments with peace of mind. Activities that infringe on the property 
rights of businesses and citizens must be investigated and dealt with severely; 
anything that has been done wrong must be corrected.”</span></p>

<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 150%">While reviewing 
the governmental achievements, “with an 8.5-percent increase in profits, 
industrial enterprises reversed the previous year’s negative growth of 2.3 
percent. Energy consumption per unit of GDP fell by 5 percent. Economic 
performance improved markedly in quality and returns”, it stated that “t<span style="color: #231F20">he 
trial replacement of business tax with value added tax (VAT) was extended to 
cover all sectors, slashing the tax burden of businesses for the year by over 
570 billion yuan and reducing tax burdens in every sector”, including nonpublic 
sector which enjoyed both the polices of proactive fiscal and tax reduction.</span></span></p>

<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 150%">However, the 
Report addressed many difficulties, “yet we must not lose sight of the many 
problems and challenges China faces in pursuing economic and social development. 
The internal forces driving economic growth need to be strengthened. 
Overcapacity poses a serious challenge in some industries. Some enterprises face 
difficulties in their production and operations. Economic prospects for 
different regions are divergent. Fiscal imbalance is becoming great. And 
potential economic and financial risks cannot be overlooked. Environmental 
pollution remains grave, and in particular, some areas are frequently hit by 
heavy smog. We need to further strengthen our steps to combat pollution. There 
are also many problems causing public concern in housing, education, healthcare, 
elderly care, food and drug safety, and income distribution. It is distressing 
that there were some major accidents in the coal mining, construction, and 
transportation sectors.</span></p>

<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 150%">There is still 
room for improvement in government performance. Some reform policies and 
measures have not been fully implemented. Excess fees and charges being levied 
on businesses and difficulties facing individuals who want to access government 
services remain standout problems. We still see problems of laws and regulations 
being enforced in a nonstandard, unfair, or uncivil way. A small number of 
government employees are lazy and neglectful of their duties or shirk 
responsibility. Corruption often occurs in some sectors.”</span></p>

</span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 150%">mentioned 
that China was <span style="background: white">beset with difficulties at home 
and abroad, </span>“2016 was an unusual year in our country’s development. China 
was confronted with an external environment in which the world saw the lowest 
economic and trade growth in seven years, growing volatility in global financial 
markets, and sudden and frequent regional and global challenges. Domestically, 
China faced multiple difficulties: major structural problems, prominent risks 
and dangers, and mounting downward pressure on the economy. China found itself 
in a complex environment as reform entered a critical stage, profound changes 
took place affecting interests, and factors impacting social stability grew.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%; layout-grid-mode: char; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 30px">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 150%">This complex 
environment is due to the capitalist market economy promoted by the CCP. The 
more China opens its door to foreign countries, the more affected by them as the 
interrelations are frequent. In the domestic aspect, private property is getting 
strengthened, leading to problems such as class polarization, a widening gap of 
the rich and poor, serious class struggle, and serious conflicts between the 
government and people. This was exactly what the Report called “factors 
impacting social stability grew”.</span></p>

<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 150%">In order to 
boast about President Xi Jinping’s great leadership, the Report mentioned his 
name ten times. It indeed deployed a tactic of personal cult. Yet, he has to 
bear the weight of responsibility of causing and worsening the above complicated 
dilemma.</span></p>
