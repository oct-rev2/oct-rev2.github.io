<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">After eight years of suffering in 
prison, Liu Xiaobo was granted medical parole after being diagnosed with 
terminal liver cancer. This has caused widespread concerns once the news was 
announced. According to senior doctors, he may have half a year to live if he 
can get targeted therapy.</span></p>

<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">According to <i>Ming Po</i>, dated 
27 June, during the student movement of 1989, he joined hunger strike for three 
days, and he successfully negotiated with the student leaders and the army 
commander to let all the several thousand students withdraw peacefully from the 
Tiananmen Square. In 1991, he was convicted for the offense of 
“counter-revolutionary propaganda and incitement” but exempted from criminal 
punishment for his </span>

having avoided the possible bloody confrontation in Tiananmen Square.</span></p>

<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">In 1996, he was ordered to serve 
three years of&nbsp;re-education through labor “for disturbing public order”. In the 
same year, at the labor camp, he married&nbsp;Liu Xia. After his release, he resumed 
his freelance writing. In 2008, Liu was detained due to his participation with 
the&nbsp;<i>Charter08</i>&nbsp;Manifesto. Then he was formally arrested on suspicion of 
“inciting subversion of state power” and was sentenced to eleven years' 
imprisonment in Mianzhou Prison, Liaoning Province. What Liu has done is to 
exercise his rights of freedom of speech, but was wrongfully sentenced to prison 
and now dying. He was awarded the&nbsp;2010 Nobel Peace Prize, showing that he has 
already obtained sympathy and support within and outside the country.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 30px">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">Liu should not have been sentenced 
to prison because of his speech. He then suffered seriously and is dying. He 
should be freed unconditionally, rather than to be granted medical parole. This 
is a very urgent call to free him. Otherwise, the Chinese authorities should be 
charged of intentional murder and to be condemned by history.</span></p>

<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">Actually, Liu Xia asked for medical 
report from the hospital but was rejected. She also repeatedly asked for 
overseas treatment but rejected again and again. Due to his deteriorating health 
which could not afford chemical treatment, he was then sent to hospital. 
However, he got the terminal liver cancer which cannot be cured in the country, 
and worse still, he cannot be allowed to go abroad. It obviously shows that the 
authorities have an intention to murder him.</span></p>

<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt">The brutality and </span>
<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 12.0pt">savagery of the Chinese authorities 
has already outraged the public inside and outside the country. There is 
widespread call for an unconditional release of Liu Xiaobo and letting him go 
abroad for medical treatment. Whether the CCP and the government make compromise 
largely depends on the development of public pressure.</span></p>
