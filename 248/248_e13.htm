<span style="font-size: 12.0pt">On 3 September 2020</span><span lang="EN-HK" style="font-size: 12.0pt">, 
t</span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">he State Council Information Office held 
a regular policy briefing regarding the arrangements that were made at the 
recent executive meeting of the State Council for flood prevention, disaster 
relief and post-disaster recovery. Zhou Xuewen, secretary general of the 
National Flood Control and Drought Relief Command Headquarters, deputy minister 
of Emergency Management and deputy minister of Water Resources, indicated that 
since 1998, China has suffered the most severe floods. 751 rivers in 25 
provincial regions have experienced floods with major rivers and lakes like the 
Yangtze River, Yellow River and Lake Taihu visited by 18 numbered floods.
<span style="color: black">China </span>has received 555.6 millimeters of 
precipitation, almost 10.6 percent more than the average over the past five 
years. This year's precipitation is the second worst since 1961, exceeded only 
by 1998 Flood.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The wide-ranging, 
long-lasting floods have affected 70.4 million people in 28 provincial regions, 
which increased 17 percent from the five-year average. Direct economic losses 
caused by the disasters have increased by 27 percent from the five-year average 
to almost 214 billion yuan ($31.3 billion). However, the death toll or missing 
in floods decreased 49.8 percent from the five-year average to 271. About 4.7 
million people have been evacuated, 47.3 percent more than the average of the 
past five years. The Ministry of Emergency Management and the Ministry of 
Finance have distributed almost 1.5 billion yuan of disaster relief funds and 
about 195,000 disaster-relief materials have also been dispatched to the 
affected regions.</span></p>

Urbanization</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; color: black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Sichuan province was particularly seriously affected, for example Leshan City 
and Jintang County of Chengdu City. Generally speaking, the quality of flood 
control facilities in many cities is inferior. One of the main problems is rapid 
urbanization. In 2010, Chen Weizhong, an expert of irrigation, pointed out that 
the rainfall could not go down through hard surfaced road to become underground 
water. Due to rapid urbanization, rivers, streams, ponds, and farmland have been 
occupied and destroyed, which has limited the capacity to channel floodwater.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">Climate Change</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 24.0pt">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt">On 24 August 2020, China Meteorological 
Administration issued <i>Blue Book on Climate Change in China 2020</i>, which 
provided the latest monitoring information on the climate change status in China 
and the whole world from the aspects of atmosphere, hydrosphere, cryosphere, 
terrestrial biosphere and driving factors of climate change.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Blue Book 
indicates that many key indicators of the climate system are taking on 
accelerating changes. China, as a region susceptible to climate change, is 
confronted with more extreme climate conditions, pronounced regional differences 
of precipitation changes, and more days of rainstorm. It boasts a bettering 
ecological climate but faces more unstable conditions in terms of regional 
ecological environment.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The global average 
temperature in 2019 is 1.1℃ higher than that of pre-industrial levels, ranking 
second since the complete meteorological observation on record. Since the 1980s, 
every consecutive decade has witnessed warmer conditions compared with the 
previous one. In 2019, land surface temperature on average in Asia came second 
since the beginning of the 20th century. From 1951 to 2019, annual average 
temperature in China had risen by 0.24℃ per decade, with the rate dramatically 
higher than the global average level in the same period.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From 1961 to 2019, 
annual average precipitation in China is on mild increase, with more extreme 
heavy rain events and more days of rainstorm. Precipitation changes in all 
regions take on noticeable differences. From 1870 to 2019, average global sea 
surface temperature has notably risen. In 2019, global average sea level is 
accelerating its rise. The sea level change in coastal regions of China is on 
volatile rise. The rate is higher than the global average level in the same 
period. From 1960 to 2019, global mountain glaciers are in melting and 
retreating condition. The year 2019 is the most intense year of global glacier 
melt since 1960.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">Concluding remarks</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 24.0pt">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; background: white">In 2018, the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) issued a special report on the 
impacts of global warming of 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels and related 
global greenhouse gas emission pathways. The scientists remarked that there was
</span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">emerging evidence of human influence on 
global atmospheric moisture content and precipitation. According to the 
Clausius-Clapeyron relationship, the saturation vapor pressure increased 
approximately exponentially with temperature. It was physically plausible that 
relative humidity would remain roughly constant under climate change. This meant 
that specific humidity increased about 7% for a one degree increase in 
temperature in the current climate.</span></p>
<p class="Default" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: 24.0pt">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif">In 2010, Chen Weizhong warned 
that in the expansion of urbanization, the cities have reduced their capacity to 
control floodwaters. Same or lesser volume of rainfalls would lead to more 
serious consequences. In summary, rapid urbanization makes floods worse. Thus, 
de-urbanization/de-industrialization is one of the key solutions to deal with 
climate change and serious floods. </span></p>
