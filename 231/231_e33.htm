<p class="MsoNormal" style="layout-grid-mode: char">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 11.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On September 14, 2011, 
Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao with high profile pleaded for political reform when 
he attended the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting of the New Champions, also 
known as the Summer Davos Forum, in Dalian, a coastal city in northeast China's 
Liaoning Province. Wen offered his “five points of political reform”: 1. ruling 
the country by law, and ensuring separation of the party and government; 2. 
promoting social justice, addressing unfair distribution of wages and closing 
the gap between the rich and the poor; 3. ensuring an impartial and independent 
judiciary; 4. protecting the democratic rights of the people and expanding 
grassroots elections; 5. opposing corruption, requiring government officials to 
make public their financial affairs. For the past two years, Wen repeated his 
idea about political restructure in different public events. Wen </span>
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 11.0pt">presented himself as </span>
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 11.0pt">a modest reformist within the 
Chinese Communist Party, whose position is similar to Zhao Ziyang. In 1989, 
Zhao, accompanied by Wen, visited the students and protesters on Tiananmen 
Square. Later Zhao stepped down and Wen went into disappearance for a long time.</span></p>

China should push for economic, political, cultural and social reforms. On the 
other hand, the conservative faction of the leadership dismissed any notion of 
political reform. Wu Bangguo, the chairman of the National People's Congress, 
advocated the five </span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 11.0pt">NOs</span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 11.0pt">:

relocation disputes, property disputes, restructuring disputes, medical

<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 11.0pt">these disputes </span>
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 11.0pt">are caused by the complicated and

Wukan Villagers of Guangdong Province protested against the land grabbing by the 
local government and a Hong Kong capitalist. Longtou Villagers also complained 
about the illegal land confiscation by the developers. Irritated by land

many social conflicts yet to be disclosed.</span></p>

<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 11.0pt">The public health services have 
become worse. China Central Television reported that hospitals made 5 times 
profits from the most 20 popular drugs, some even gained 65 times. Doctors were 
involved in sharing the profits. <i>People’s Daily</i>, dated 1 September, 
reported two cruel medical events. In Wuhan city of Hubei Province, a doctor 
immediately tore open the stitched wound of a peasant worker once he admitted he 
did not have enough money.</span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 11.0pt">

<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 11.0pt">Capitalist economy has led to 
social indifference, moral decline, profit-orientation and selfishness. For 
example, in Foshan City of Guangdong Province, a two-year-old girl, Yueyue, was 
knocked down by two cars, but none of the 18 passengers turned a blind eye. In 
Shandong Province, a five-year-old boy was dying due to the collapse of the 
house, but no one gave him a hand. These events stirred national debates about 
moral decline.</span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 11.0pt"> </span>
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 11.0pt">Wen Jiabao criticized the moral 
decline but the editorial of <i>Guangming Daily</i> refuted the fact.</span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 11.0pt">
</span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 11.0pt">Nonetheless, according to <i>
Wen Wei Po</i> dated 23 October, the research conducted by the Global Net and 
Global Public Opinion Research Center stated that 86% of the interviewees 
thought the moral standard largely declined in today China, and officials, 
doctors and businessmen were considered to be the most immoral groups.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="layout-grid-mode: char">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 11.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other figures prove that 
there is widening gap between the rich and the poor in China. The Gini 
Coefficient has already gone beyond 0.4, the acceptable line. According to <i>
Wen Wei Po</i> dated 6 December, the gap between the highest income group and 
the lowest income group in the city is also enlarging. It increased from 2.9 
times in 1985 to 8.9 times in 2009. According to <i>Xinjing Daily</i> dated 8 
December, the research conducted by Guangzhou Popular Opinion Research Center 
showed that in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou, the elites with high income were 
81% satisfied with the reality but the grassroots, only 18%. Meanwhile, Fang 
Xiaojian, the head of Poverty Alleviation Office of the State Council, estimated 
that at the end of 2011, there would be 128 millions of rural poor, which 
accounted for 13.4% of the whole rural population. According to the research on 
peasants in current development situation conducted by Central China Normal 
University in Wuhan, the percentage of peasants who felt they were respected by 
doctors, officials and the rich were respectively </span>
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 11.0pt">4.7</span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 11.0pt">%,

<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 11.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the above, we can 
conclude that the political system has caused serious consequences and it should 
completely be reformed. But the conservatives within the party refused to make 
any change even when reformists such as Zhao and Wen proposed modest reforms. 
Hence, only radical reforms will be the solution to solve the problem.</span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 11.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
